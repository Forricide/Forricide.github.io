<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">"There are two reasons why we don't travel by Jran often," Rèmsciore said. "Do either of you know what they are?"</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso considered the question. "If they travel in packs, and you can only use the calming spell on one at a time, then it's unpredictable. You'd need to make sure you have enough people with you to handle however many might appear."</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">Something about Rèmsciore's smile put Maso on edge. "I would've just said that we prefer our arms attached to our torsos, but that works too. The second reason is more important, though."</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">"There aren't many things more important than <i>staying alive</i>," Lanoch said.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"Mm." Rèmsciore turned away from them, stroking the chin of the Jran that was still resting its body on the sand. It stared up at him contentedly. "Do you know how old this Jran is?"</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">Lanoch shrugged. "How would I know that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">"Look at the size of its neck and the overlap of its scales," Rèmsciore said. "As they age, their neck only slows its growth, never actually stopping. The scales, too - they increase in size, but slower than their body."</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso squinted, trying to discern exactly what state the Jran was in. It was true that the beast's scales didn't quite touch each other, small gaps formed between them that left little centimenter-thick lines of skin showing underneath. The neck, too, was long - but Maso had no context for that, outside of an assumption that anything much longer would become unwieldy. "How old is it?" he asked.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">"Likely over three hundred years."</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>What?</i>" coughed Maso. "How is that possible?"</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">"Magical creatures can live for a long time," Lanoch explained, still nonchalant. She was picking at something on the back of her hand, barely paying attention. "It's hardly unheard of. Smaller magical creatures without proper predators can live for much longer, too."</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes," Rèmsciore said. There was a serious tone in his voice that was out of character to Maso - not upset or angry, but... almost reverent. "This creature has experienced much more of life than most ever will. It has a kind of knowledge that is unlike ours, but still real. They're not mindless, they're <i>intelligent</i> creatures. To force it through the indignity of <i>riding</i> it just for convenience's sake is... cruel."</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Bwahahaha!" Lanoch burst out. "<i>That's</i> what's got you so worked up? I can't believe you, of all people, would fall for that kind of nonsense. It's an <i>animal</i>. It doesn't have thoughts like that. Sure, they're 'intelligent'. It's mostly used to figure out ways to attack people. And besides, with the magic you've used on it, it <i>wants</i> to help us."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">"No. This is... a perversion."</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Right. What an incredibly useful tool to discard because you think you might hurt an animal's <i>feelings</i>."</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">It was hard to disagree with Lanoch. The Origin didn't have any kind of creatures like this - Maso would have known if it did - but if they'd existed, they'd have been made use of to the fullest extent possible. That was simply what life on the Origin was like; they had to use any possible tools to survive.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">The only thing that mattered was the survival and furthering of the human race. Which was the reason Maso was here in the first place. <i>And probably a good reason to hurry up</i>, he thought.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Before he said anything, Rèmsciore continued. "I won't argue with you about this now. I only did it because this is the only way we can find those children in in time. Get on, or stay behind, I don't care."</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">They got on.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">The process of riding a Jran was about what Maso would have expected.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">It was almost obvious just from looking at the thing. The concave nature of its large shell made it seem like it was purpose-built to be a seat of some kind, large enough on this beast to fit easily five or six people. The three of them could sit down easily within it, kneeling in a tight triangle.</p></a><p><b><a href="Ch12.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

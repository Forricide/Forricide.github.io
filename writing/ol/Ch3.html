<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're not Rùndi!"</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Who's Rùndi?</i>, some part of Maso responded instinctively.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">The rest of him was in complete disarray.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">A torrent of sounds had to be parsed, half of them unrecognized and discarded, the rest nonsensical - haphazard clanging of machinery, unmuffled cries of children, different voices shouting over one another. One seemed to be yelling about cooked fruit, while another extolled the virtues of some kind of footwear, and as Maso's brain caught up with his senses, he processed more, slowly segmenting the flood of information into more manageable parts.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso could feel his body again, but there was something off about it. Multiple things, the more he focused on it.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">He had eyes again, but no information display appeared. He could feel his legs, but no connection to the large data stores that were implanted in them. In fact, outside of the neural blocker whose diagnostics he could still vaguely sense, none of his augments had returned.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">The lack of information was something he'd grown used to in the void. He'd hated it, but he hadn't even been sure he still <i>existed</i>. Now it surged back into being a major irritant: his training was yelling at him to resync with his data stores, to turn on active location scanning, to reconnect with his muscle stabilizers - and he couldn't.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">That wasn't all. Moments before, when he'd been... <i>ejected</i> from the void, he'd had the vague feeling of being taller, somehow stretched. That sensation was doubled now, even though he hadn't looked at his limbs. It didn't feel wrong, really. Just different.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso cut off that train of thought, reorienting himself. All of this was important information, but solving those problems could wait for later.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">He filed the information away. Or attempted to, at least: without access to his main memory augments, he'd have to rely on more fallible human memory, like he had in the void. Even while he'd been in the void, he'd started to notice that he was forgetting information he'd read earlier, which he found somewhat concerning.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Finally, Maso opened his eyes.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">And then immediately closed them.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">He was outside, and lacking a filtration system.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">His vision would deteriorate in less than three minutes.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">There would be serious long-term health effects within ten.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd completely run out of oxygen in twenty-three-</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>This isn't the Origin</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">The frantic thoughts stopped, and for a moment he relaxed, still ignoring the sounds and smells and odd poking sensation at his thigh.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"Hello? I saw you move," the voice beside him said, sounding mildly annoyed. "If that's you, Rùndi, I hope you know dad is going to be <i>very</i> upset."</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">Mildly annoyed, but unhurried. Now that Maso's mind was slowly making it towards the 'less important' observations, he'd noticed that it was warm, but not painfully so. A comfortable heat was hitting the front of his body, and he could feel the warmth spreading across his face, almost as pleasant a feeling as the sauna he'd used once.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">The furniture he was resting on was also nice, gently supporting his back with-</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"If you don't say something, I will roll you off the roof."</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso opened his eyes.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Now that he could get a good look at the sky, he realized it was far more interesting than he'd thought. On the Origin, the sky was always overcast, filled with thick and overlapping clouds that blocked most of the local star, leaving its light filtered and scarce. Here, the clouds were thin and diffuse, scattered across the sky like smears of paint. The sky itself was a brilliant blue, and Maso blinked, taking it in.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">Perhaps more importantly, there was a woman standing beside him, hands on her hips. She looked to be in her twenties, maybe, but Maso had never been a good guess of age; the stern expression on her face reminded him of his mother, many years ago.</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>She's hardly wearing any clothes,</i> Maso realized. She had a shirt on, but it didn't even come past her elbows; her pants barely reached her <i>knees</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">It was a different planet, he knew, and the air <i>did</i> seem cleaner - but the sight was still bizarre.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">The woman's frown deepened. "Okay, is there anyone in there? I'm going to need a good explanation for how you've respawned on my balcony. This is private property..."</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm Maso," he said. Possibly not the best opener, but in fairness, he was still reeling from the amount of new information.</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">"So you <i>can</i> talk. That's very nice," she said, voice flat. "Well, Maso. Again. I'm going to need a good explanation for why you're <i>here</i>, now."</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso immediately regretted not thinking harder about this while he was in the void. If there were some kind of people on this planet, he couldn't tell them that he'd come from the Origin. Their appearances and supposedly long history made it <i>likely</i> that he'd somehow found settlers from a previous epoch, but he couldn't know for sure. The rarity of such an encounter was abysmal already, and the networked intelligences back on the Origin should have prevented even that small of a possibility from occurring.</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">And if this was a fully alien planet, he couldn't know how its citizens would react to hearing about the Origin and its widespread interstellar <i>expeditions</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">Well. Admittedly, even if they <i>were</i> humans of a previous epoch, he couldn't know if they'd be friendly. Although they were a frequent study of scientists hoping to piece together long-lost innovations, the civilizations that had previously inhabited the Origin were mostly an enigma. Why they'd done what they'd done to the planet was fun to guess at, but mostly pointless; why they'd tried to leave was obvious; whether or not they'd succeeded was a complete mystery.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">Going deeper than that was an anthropological effort that most considered a waste of time. It was possible that the networked intelligences could solve these problems, but to waste their time on it would have been a near heretical notion.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">In other words: </p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">As Maso was struggling to come up with an explanation that wasn't <i>completely</i> nonsensical, taking into consideration what he'd learned in the void, something appeared in his vision.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">At first, he ignored it. It looked similar to the information display provided by his vision augments, and he'd long become accustomed to simply not seeing the information overlaid on his retinas when he didn't need to.</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">After a moment, though, some part of his subconscious recalled that he didn't <i>have</i> vision augments anymore.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">His eyes refocused, and he read the text that had appeared in front of him.</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">x>quest</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">New Quest!</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">"Lie Through Your Teeth"</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Find a good excuse for how you've ended up here. Bonus points for figuring out where "here" is! </p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">Rewards: Information, very unlikely to be tortured.</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">Penalties for Failure: The System would be very disappointed in you.</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">x>end</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>What?</i>" he said.</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">"I <i>said</i>, I need an explanation for why you're here, now," the woman repeated, unmoving. Some part of Maso recognized that her left hand was holding an extremely long and sharp knife. Had that been there before?</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">He reread the text, anyways.</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">After a moment, he connected her appearance with one of the species he'd read about </p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">And apparently <i>taller</i>, too. Even though she was peering down at him, he could </p></a><p><b><a href="Ch2.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

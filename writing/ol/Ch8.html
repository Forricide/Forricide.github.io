<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Childhood on the Origin was short. Parents were often busy with assignments, so they passed their children off to care providers. The children with fewer prospects found themselves in more crowded, smaller classrooms, with lower quality air and a lack of good activities. It was a necessary evil - there wasn't enough space to go around, so although most such children would have been malleable enough to learn more, preliminary testing left them deprioritized in favour of more immediately talented ones.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso's early assessments had been moderately positive; not nearly good enough to be tracked into a research or engineering field, but sufficient for a decent picking of career paths. Still, the first decade or so of his life had been stuffy and isolated, the bleakness of their surroundings and education stifling his cohort's desire for camaraderie or play. Immersives were the foundation of his (and most of his peers') childhood, allowing an escape from one's surroundings into a more pleasant environment.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">There had been no avoiding the fact, though, that those environments were purely educational. That led to its own unique feeling of blandness over time. Resplendent vistas were only so interesting when one was frantically searching for a way to start a fire to cauterize their wound; dark caves lost their charm when it was necessary to light them up in order to recognize an arbitrary set of minerals.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">As such, despite the admittedly fantastical nature of the exercises, there was never any <i>true</i> escape.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">The exact concept of magic was foreign to Maso, but he could remember dreaming of similar things. Early on, he'd daydreamed of shocking his tutors with feats of logic and cunning, rising above his classmates and achieving impossible scholarships. Later, as he started preliminary training on his final career path, he'd sometimes imagined himself being absurdly skilled in spatial combat, defeating bizarre aliens with fantastical weaponry.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, something like that old desire had started to bubble up in him. He <i>had to</i> find a way to contact the Origin, to find a way to escape this planet and fulfill his mission objectives. For that, he needed to understand the strange systems by which this world worked, so magic was a prerequisite regardless.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Seeing what was possible with magic had started to add on to that. He wanted to summon lightning with a phrase, to freeze enemies in their tracks. It was practical, it would further his objectives, but most importantly - right now, at least - it was just <i>cool</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"The first thing you need to know," Rèmsciore said, ducking under a tree branch, "is that most magic is very slow to use."</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">"How slow?" Maso was barely keeping up, finding himself wading through deep shrubs and low branches that Rèmsciore seemed to glide past. He assumed it was a skill that one would naturally pick up from spending a long time in the forest. Useful, but not worth the time investment. Maso <i>hoped</i> he'd never become that good.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"That depends," Rèmsciore said, glancing back at Maso. "For me, not too slow." He grinned, hopping over a log without looking. "For you, well, it might be wise to get used to a sword."</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">"It can't be that bad," Maso said. "At least I can say the words while fighting."</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah." Rèmsciore stopped, and Maso stumbled slightly to avoid running into him. "No, I'm afraid not. It's not possible to use spells without accessing your crann, you see."</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"What?"</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">The other Aspen turned around to look at him. For the first time, he seemed somewhat serious - not upset, but deep in thought. "How about I show you something?"</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Sure."</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">Rèmsciore turned on the spot, looking at the surrounding forest. This wasn't an area Maso had been in before, but it was no different than what he'd started to become used to: dense tree covering, thick shrubs layered on top of each other, branches barring every possible path.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"There," Rèmsciore said, pointing at a rather large rock that jutted out of the surrounding shrubs, maybe a stone's throw away. "Do you think you could hit that - say, with a bow?"</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso had never used a bow - he was only remotely familiar with the concept from a single ancient weapons course he'd taken out of interest - but he imagined he could hit the rock with <i>any</i> weapon, considering it wasn't moving... and bigger than two people. "Yes."</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"All right." He took in a deep breath, pointed with one hand - not his sword hand, Maso noticed - and spoke: "<i>Bisect.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph"> Several things happened at once.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">Firstly, the rock did not move. This was the standard behaviour of a rock, at least within Maso's past experiences with them. However, in this case, he had to admit that he'd expected something... else.</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">Well. He <i>did</i> get something else, at least. An ear-splitting <i>crack</i> rang through the air, almost causing him to flinch. Where? He'd been focused on the rock, so it took him a moment to realize.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Behind him and Rèmsciore, a massive tree truck had just split in two, and was <i>falling towards him-</i></p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Instinct kicked in. Maso lunged forward, wrapping one arm around Rèmsciore's body, and pulled them both forward as hard as he could. The other man had still been turning his head, and must have been surprised when Maso hit him, because he let out a strange <i>whuff</i> at the contact.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">They toppled over together after a moment, amidst the sounds of cracking wood and crashing branches, landing in some foliage only a step or two away from where the tree itself had fallen.</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah," Rèmsciore said, lying on the ground face up. "Thanks! I didn't expect the angle to have changed so much in the last year or two."</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso brought himself to his knees, panting. His neural augment had kicked in within a millisecond of him noticing the tree, and had started to pump regulated amounts of adrenaline; he gave a silent command for it to stop, and felt a pressure in his brain release.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">"What was that?" he said, after a moment.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"Bisect," Rèmsciore answered. "It's an old spell-"</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">"No. I mean, why did you just <i>do</i> that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">He shrugged. "It's a good demonstration. I don't suppose you're still wondering why we cast spells through the crann, now, are you?"</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">"A good demonstration." Maso drew his mouth into a line. "I prefer my demonstrations with less <i>getting crushed by falling trees.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">"Again," Rèmsciore said, standing up and brushing himself off. "It's not a big deal. I just got a little surprised, that's all. Nothing bad came of it, eh? The best lesson is the one you don't forget!"</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">"Right." Maso watched the other man finish brushing himself off, then start walking again. Begrudgingly, he followed. <i>Everyone here is insane.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"Anyhow, "</p></a><p><b><a href="Ch7.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">There were fewer people on the streets today. Maso didn't blame them; it was windy, leaves rustling noisily in the background. The lowest floors of the buildings around them had now been completely cleared out, what little remained packed into wooden crates fastened solidly to their wooden frames.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Without the children playing in the streets, the busy food stands and loud conversations, the village was completely desolate. It reminded Maso more of his home, now, albeit less cramped and with much fresher air.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">The stark contrast to just a day or two before highlighted how small the village really was. They had been walking for three or four minutes, and were nearly at the beach, gusts of wind turning into a damp breeze.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Of course, Maso had no real context for most of the climate here. On the Origin, weather was a real and constant threat; from severe windstorms carrying toxic particles to rain that rapidly ate away at any human construct, there were enough dangers outside to make it consistently inhospitable without the correct equipment.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">And everyone who did spend time in the outdoors, anyone who worked on infrastructure or research or just had to travel to other population centers for any reason - they all inevitably thought about the same thing. <i>What did this world look like before?</i></p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">Whatever the true answer to that question was, Maso found it hard to imagine being anything like <i>this.</i> As they passed the last of the village's increasingly ramshackle buildings, he could take in the beach - for only the second time in the few days he'd been here.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">It was perfection.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, slightly less so today, with blowing sand obscuring some of his vision, and a distinct turmoil to the ocean that made it less than clear. But the absolute desolation of the place made up for it - only a single Aspen was present, a man standing some distance down the beach, staring out into the ocean. Otherwise, it was cleared out, an uncountable number of footprints and small bits of debris being wiped away as they watched, wind pushing sand into holes and toppling small constructs that children had built only days prior.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Lanoch, who was walking a pace or two ahead of them, strode directly towards the beach, bare feet digging into the ground slightly with every step. Rèmsciore's footsteps were considerably deeper. The taller man seemed to be lost in thought, staring at the ground as he walked. Maso stayed to his left, taking in the sights. Both Lanoch and Rèmsciore were native to this world; as a visitor - a tourist, if he really stretched it - he felt obligated to enrich his time by enjoying the landscape.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">The ocean appeared to stretch infinitely in every direction, its brilliant blue colour reflecting starlight into his eyes. If he squinted and stared North, he thought he could see some land; from the map of the continent he'd seen, it was <i>supposed</i> to be visible there. But the wayfinder had no data on any other landmasses, and indeed he couldn't make out anything other than ocean and clouds in any other direction.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Just an endless body of water, enough for every human on the Origin to never go thirsty.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Maso wondered briefly if they'd come here, assuming he was able to somehow communicate with anyone back on the Origin. Would humanity finally have a new, properly hospitable home? Would they bring their networked intelligences, and their plans and methods of development?</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">Staring out at the picturesque ocean, an image flashed into Maso's mind of the small bodies of water that still existed on the Origin, disgustingly dark and contaminated. Previous iterations of humanity had - somehow managed to do <i>that</i> to an entire planet's source of water.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>That wouldn't happen again,</i> Maso thought resolutely.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Lanoch cleared her through, bringing him out of his thoughts. He stopped beside Rèmsciore, Lanoch having turned to face the two of them.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">"How we'll travel north is simple," she said. "We'll take a Jran. It's the right time of year for it, so there should be quite a few near the coast."</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"A jir-what?" Maso asked.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">"A <i>Jran</i>," Lanoch said, rolling the <i>r</i> more noticeably this time, "is just an ocean creature. They're usually quite dangerous to get close to, but that's why most Aspen have learned the magic required to pacify them. If it's used properly, I've heard they're compliant enough to ride for quite a distance, too." </p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Something touched the side of Maso's head, and he spun around - only to see that it was Rèmsciore's <i>hair</i>, the man whipping his head back and forth so vigorously it took a moment for Maso to realize that it was supposed to be an emphatic <i>no</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"I take it you don't like this idea, either," Lanoch said, rolling her eyes. "It's okay. You don't have to come, after all."</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're insane," Rèmsciore said, apparently realizing that his head-shaking hadn't managed to communicate his message. "Those things could eat someone my size without choking."</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"Right," Lanoch said, "which is why you'd use the magic to keep it calm, so we can travel safely. To <i>your</i> friends, mind you."</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">"Firstly, the spell for that is known to be unreliable, especially when used by someone who's not experienced with it. Secondly, just getting near those beasts is a recipe for trouble, using them as a <i>shortcut</i> is frankly ridiculous-"</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">"I thought Jran was how everyone here traveled long distances by water," Lanoch cut in.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"- no, well, <i>yes</i>, which is exactly why nobody <i>does</i> it-"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"But you were in the military. Wouldn't that require "</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"No, because we're not <i>insane</i> - just who do you think we are? We're not <i>Avalla</i>, we don't stick our noses - or beaks, whichever - where they don't belong. We patrol our "</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">Lanoch stared him in the eyes. "Our <i>own</i> territory. Right."</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">There was a sudden silence.</p></a><p><b><a href="Ch11.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

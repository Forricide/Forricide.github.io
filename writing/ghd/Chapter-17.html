<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph"><b>One Month Later</b></p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil set down his pen. He hadn't actually used it - typing was simply more efficient - but holding it gave him a sense of poise, so he tended to roll it around in his fingers while thinking.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">The experience he'd gained - the life experience of single-handedly defeating an Endbringer - had been directly invested into his writing. He'd written a documentary-style perspective on the Endbringer fight, and that combined with the "Verified Brockton Bay Resident" tag had netted him a solid increase to his readership.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Sure, he hadn't conquered the city in the aftermath (although from reading the news, it seemed like the Undersiders were doing an excellent job of that). He hadn't even filled a hole in the PRT and advanced his position. But that was fine: he'd filled a hole in his own <i>self</i>. He'd slowly cast off most of his responsibilities as Coil, delegating more and more to his (surviving) mercenaries. He'd quit his job as a PRT consultant, citing stress related reasons.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, he was free for the first time he could remember to simply be himself. To write, drink, and - well, there wasn't much else, but he figured this was what he'd wanted anyways.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">In both worlds he still occupied, he spent the days writing, reading bad forum posts, and thinking.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">This was bliss.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">This was-</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">His phone rang. A familiar ringtone.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Be my pet, be my pet..."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">He answered: "Coil here, wassup?"</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Coil. I was speaking with the rest of the Undersiders, and we'd like to meet up, one last time."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, to thank me for my role in your extreme success as the city's overlords? Hardly necessary, I should think. Seeing Mantabee nearly suffocate gang members with manatees on television was reward enough."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Nah, actually, we just wanted to put a pin into our prior business relationship."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, that's very thoughtful, but I'm a busy man, Tattletale. Have you considered simply writing an email?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I think you'll get the message better in person,"</i> she replied. <i>"Why don't you open your door?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil immediately decided to not open his door. He was in his office; it was likely Tattletale was simply playing one of her 'practical jokes' on him, like the assassin a few months ago or the poison in the PRT's cafeteria food. However, he'd realized over time that it was better to be safe rather than sorry, so in one world he left the office through a hidden door. He'd had it installed behind a bookcase; he figured that no assailant would ever look there, because if someone were to <i>actually</i> attack his base, they surely wouldn't be intelligent enough to read.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">In the reality where he was still in the office, and hadn't hung up the phone, Tattletale said: <i>"What's wrong, Coil? Afraid of the dark? Listen, just open the door, and I won't have to use this-here laser gun to open it. Things might get... well, my aim isn't very good, Coil."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil was, unfortunately for the door, too busy to open it; he was trying to access the security cameras, but none of the passwords he'd stored on highly secure post-it notes seemed to be working.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Okay, fine. I'll admit it, I have the key. I just wanted to get you to open the door,"</i> Tattletale said over the phone.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">The door clicked and opened.</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, Britters," Coil said, clasping his hands on his desk. "It's you. What can I do for-ah."</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">The entirety of the Undersiders, alongside several other of Coil's mercenaries, filed into the office behind him.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">"What's all of this?" Coil asked. "I didn't know you'd made so many friends, Tattletale."</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale smirked. "Really, Coil. It was chi-"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm surprised, because your personality is so toxic."</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"...thanks, I guess," she said. "Anyways. I don't know what you've been planning for the last month, but I knew it was something big. So we're here to head that off. Permanently."</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">Regent, standing behind her, made a slashing motion across his neck, presumably to indicate his displeasure at having to listen to Tattletale speak more than one sentence.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"It's nothing personal, Coil," she said, drawing a pistol. "I'm sure you understand."</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">Before he could even react, Coil was left with just one self; one world, again, for the first time in weeks.</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">From a distance, filtering through the tunnel he had been fast-walking through, he could hear voices.</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd accomplished so much in this continuity - did it really have to end like this? It felt so <i>random</i>. So <i>unfair</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil groaned. It was fine. He'd improved himself, in the roundabout way that one goes about polishing a preexisting diamond. He'd do better, in the next continuity.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">He closed his eyes for a moment, mentally grieving the loss of so many great works of art, then used his power.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">A moment later, he found himself - in both worlds, as always - in a totally different location. Both selves were staring out of a glass window, admiring the sprawling city below; off in the distance, he could see the sun setting.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">He turned, and Tattletale was standing there, with the Undersiders behind her. And a half dozen mercenaries.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Oh dear.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale was speaking: "You've dented your coffers too much with buying this business complex. 'Fortress Construction'? Did you really think that starting a construction company in the wake of an Endbringer fight would really go over well?"</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>I'm here in both realities.</i> He didn't have much time - or maybe he did, there was no way of knowing. He'd been trying to avoid using his power too much, to avoid possibly ending up in a continuity where he was dead, because it had been impossible to weigh the odds. However, whatever the odds were, they surely couldn't be worse than <i>this</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">He closed a reality and split again.</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">This time, he was in the sprawling yard of some mansion, back against a brick wall. Still surrounded; Tattletale was speaking, but he hardly paid attention - apparently she'd discovered that he couldn't help Noelle. Hardly the discovery of the century, really.</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">He split reality again. He'd defeated an Endbringer doing this; surely he'd find a way out of this nonsensical situation, too.</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">The second he heard Tattletale's voice, he split reality again. And again, and again, and again.</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">A beach resort. A laboratory, replete with vials of strange substances and a chair covered with blood. An honest-to-goodness <i>castle</i>, complete with a Taylor Hebert who seemed to have sprouted dragon wings and a tail. The foyer to Coil's underground base, a dozen mercenaries sprawled out on the ground.</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">Every world found him staring down the barrel of a gun.</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">His head starting to hurt, Coil activated his power, again. </p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">He found himself surrounded yet again by several of his own men - <i>Britters, again?! For shame!</i> - and the Undersiders, now helmed by an unrecognizable cape Coil assumed to be another Taylor Hebert. As always, she was wearing a different costume. This time, her mask had several strangely placed holes: one in the middle of her forehead, revealing nothing but shadow; one on her left cheek, an eye bizarrely staring out; one where her mouth should have been, but there was only skin.</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">She was speaking, and he realized her mouth was visible through the top hole, only barely.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">"No, I think-"</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil activated his power. </p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">He found himself on the ground in a street. Britters was still there, among assorted mercenaries Coil could barely remember the names of. Tattletale, Grue, and the rest of the Undersiders stood in front of him.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">Another Taylor Hebert was talking, wearing a flashier costume, cartoonish lightning bolts striking down all sides of a sky-blue suit.</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">She was finishing a sentence, and although he had the impression she wasn't putting much effort into speaking, the words boomed all the same: "<b>-it does.</b>"</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil activated his power. </p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">She was there, the Undersiders still backing her up, although Grue looked a bit worse for wear. She was above him, and it took him a second to realize she was <i>floating</i>, standing on a bizarre contraption that appeared to be old keyboards with their PS/2 cables plugged into an elderly woman who was hovering several metres above the ground. He wasn't sure what was more concerning: that the woman seemed to still be alive, or that - as far as he could tell - she was <i>enjoying</i> herself.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">The girl was holding a gun, and was looking straight at him.</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil activated his power. </p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">The Undersiders were there. Well, that might have been a strong way to put it. Grue's mask was half-destroyed and his arm was in a sling, Regent seemed to be missing his scepter, and Tattletale's mouth was looking worse for wear.</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">He closed a reality, but before he could split again, he heard the crack of a gun.</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph"><b>(Much) Later</b></p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">Floating above the wreckage of an unfamiliar city, a young woman searched. She was late, in a sense; the city had been long destroyed, and it was unlikely she'd manage to find anything she needed.</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">Still, it was possible.</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">Squinting her eyes and channelling another ghost's powers, she suddenly made out a faint shape, like the receding echo of her quarry. Abnormal, it merited investigation.</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">As she drew closer, she could make out more of the ghost. A man, in his late thirties or early forties, not angry in death: resigned, tired. Made more intriguing by the fact that he shouldn't exist - a glimmer that faint should have faded, several times over.</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">Glaistig Uaine collected the power, curious.</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph">It wasn't a particularly complicated one, she learned. A precognitive power that could simulate two separate timelines.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">Useful, perhaps, but she wasn't certain how much it would help her.</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">Before she sent it away, she considered if the power was worth using anyways. A bit of precognition was always valuable.</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">So she activated it.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-16.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

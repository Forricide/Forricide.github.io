<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">An Endbringer was here.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Here, in Brockton Bay.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">What were the odds? Surely, a fraction of a percent. There were hundreds of other cities on Earth - thousands, even. Coil's luck, he determined, was astronomically low, that an Endbringer fight would be taking place here.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Endbringer fights.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">Events that attracted the strongest, most powerful, bravest, and least intelligent parahumans. Although Coil had (obviously) always matched the first three descriptors, the last one hadn't quite fit, so he'd never even considered attending.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">It was said that, on average, only one in four capes would survive each fight. Coil had taken that statistic, and done the intensive analysis of realising that twenty-five percent was a <i>very high</i> likelihood of death.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, the beasts had come for <i>his</i> city. He didn't even have to know which one it was, to know what the likely result was: the loss of most of his minions, the utter annihilation of all his plans, the ruination of his company. And, he supposed, the deaths of several hundred thousand people, who would no longer support his day job (indirectly) through their taxes.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">The time had come to make a stand.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">It was time for an Endbringer to be pushed back, defeated by new blood, by human ingenuity and force of will.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">Time for a victory for humanity, and an end to fear, intimidation, and weakness!</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">It was a shame he wouldn't be able to watch, as he'd immediately grabbed a car to get out of the city.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, he'd attempted to do so.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Are you kidding me?" said Coil.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">Just meters away from the front of the car, swaths of citizens streamed across the road. Some shouting, others with tears streaking down their eyes, others frantically making phone calls or texts.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"This is a nightmare. The citizens are supposed to go to the shelters - why're they all on the streets?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver did not respond.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"Not only that! Have these people heard of sidewalks? I don't pay taxes every year for these people to damage my perfect asphalt with their dirty feet!"</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver tapped the steering wheel once, surveying the flood of pedestrians.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're not even listening, are you, Dinah?"</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">She tapped the steering wheel again, then turned back. "I must focus on driving. There are too many people."</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's just what I was saying!" Coil exclaimed. "Too many people. Frankly, I wouldn't even be upset if they died to an Endbringer. They deserve it."</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">Dinah opened her mouth, presumably to respond, when someone knocked on the car window.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">It was him. His muscles rippled underneath contoured armour; his jawline almost shimmered in the sunlight. Majestic in person, almost as Coil himself had described the man.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil brought down his window. "Armsmaster! What can I do for you today?"</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"It is dangerous to be driving here," the man spoke. "Please step out of the car and take your daughter to a shelter on foot."</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">It was hard to argue with six feet of power armour, so Coil complied, opening his car door.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"I understand now," Armsmaster said, as Coil stepped into the light, still clad in his costume. "You're a cape. You were trying to take her to a shelter as fast as possible, in order to make it to the resistance in time. Do not worry: I will accompany you there." </p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, well-" Coil tried.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"I will take you on my motorcycle," Armsmaster said, as he guided Dinah to the entrance of an inconveniently close Endbringer shelter. "We will make it on time." </p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">Try as he might, Coil simply couldn't resist. After all, it was an excellent opportunity to collect material for his next tinker-tech based cape fic. He could hardly pass <i>that</i> up.</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil didn't pay attention during Legend's opening speech. It was, as he'd imagined, sappy and melodramatic. It wasn't like <i>he</i> would die here, after all. He apparently had a solid seventy-five percent chance of survival, which was a satisfyingly high number.</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">Instead, Coil thought about other probabilities.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">Based on his understanding that the divergence point across the continuities he'd experienced was the trigger event of Taylor Hebert, he had to assume that - no matter how many times he used his power - there would still be certain constants. An Endbringer attack was more likely than most to be consistent. Nobody knew why they chose their targets, but Coil <i>heavily</i> doubted either he or Taylor Hebert had played any role in it.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">Following that, he determined that if he were to use his power to search for other worlds, to actually attempt to help, the outcome he'd have to search for would be a version of Taylor Hebert that had the power to actually turn back an Endbringer. No simple power would do. He'd have to find a version of her that was a one in a thousand - or even less likely - the likes of Eidolon or Alexandria.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">Meanwhile, Coil was pretty sure that no matter the odds of his being dead at this point in other continuities, it was <i>probably</i> higher than one in a thousand.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">To try, in the face of such odds: that was the action of a truly brave, courageous individual. And also one that saw the surge wave about to impact the window of the room that they were in.</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil activated his power. It took a moment to readjust and take in his surroundings, made longer by the grating sound of nails on a chalkboard.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, that was Tattletale. In the other reality, she'd already left the room.</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">"Coil? Hi? We need to go to the roof in this timeline," Tattletale was saying, in one reality. "To take a look at Leviathan - how do you not already know that? Are you concussed? More than usual, that is?"</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">They were on an upper floor of what seemed to be a business building. Coil turned to face Tattletale, who was holding a staircase door open. "Tattletale. What's Taylor Hebert's power?"</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">"What- you're not Coil," Tattletale said, and within a very startling two seconds, Coil found himself facing down the barrel of a gun. "The truce is in effect," she said. "Who are you? If this is some kind of play, you're making a big mistake."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Those were a few too many words for Coil to properly process and respond to, so instead he went with a tried-and-true tactic.</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">"Hah, do you not even know what Taylor Hebert's power is, in this continuity? And here I thought you knew everything, Tattletale."</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">She frowned. "Fine. She can control crabs. I think she's hiding in a shelter somewhere, for obvious reasons? Now, tell me what's going on."</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil merged realities and split again. This time, he was in some kind of control room. Rain pelted an external window; Coil recognized the location as being the PRT Headquarters, and spun on his heels to get to a nearby computer station. The floor was nearly empty, staffers having abandoned most of their posts, save for a few employees he didn't recognize.</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">In one reality, he opened the news and hunted for anything on the Undersiders; in the other, he went straight to the wiki. Within a minute, he had his answers: Taylor Hebert had become "Encroacher" in this continuity, an S-class threat that had apparently <i>eaten a school</i> and been summarily defeated by the Triumvirate and sent to the Birdcage. Which she had <i>then</i> escaped, and followed that up by - for whatever reason - forming a Canadian 'hero' organization and recruiting the Undersiders.</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil didn't understand the vast majority of it, but it was enough just to know that she was <i>far, far</i> away from the Bay and was unlikely to be of any help, powerful though she seemed.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">Besides, he could look out the window: although he couldn't see Leviathan, he <i>could</i> see the swells of water blowing the docks to bits.</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil split again, then looked around in both realities.</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">It took him a moment to adjust <i>again</i>, this time because there was some ringing noise in the background. For whatever reason, he was standing on the top of a building. From what he could tell, the city was even <i>more</i> destroyed in this continuity than it had been in the previous ones. Not surprising, given the entire factor of time existing, but mildly discouraging.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">He collapsed the worlds into one, then went to split again.</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">Nothing happened.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Hm, that's odd,</i> thought Coil, as his cellphone continued ringing. <i>I could have sworn my power worked just three seconds ago.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">He tried again - once, twice. No luck.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">With a heavy sigh, he pulled the phone out of his pocket. "<i>Yes</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Ah, Coil, just the man I was looking for."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"Hello, Tattletale."</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Actually, that's Ms. Wilborn to you, thank you very much. And I'm here with my... fascinating friend, who wants to speak with you."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, perhaps Taylor Hebert's power would be delivered to him regardless. Maybe it would be something useful, after all. "Go ahead," Coil said, "put them on."</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Yes, uh, hello? I hold it like this, right?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale's voice came through faintly: <i>"Yes, just speak into that microphone at the bottom. Yes, the little grates. No, it's fine, it'll pick you up."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Uh, yes, hello. This is... it doesn't matter,"</i> they continued. <i>She</i> continued. Coil shivered. There was always something oddly terrifying about the girl, even when her power was something ridiculous. <i>"What matters is, Coil, I have a power that will, with your cooperation, be able to stop the Endbringer... or prevent him from showing up in the first place."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">"Go on."</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">"My power is - and you'll have to take my word for it - that every time I kill a bug, you retroactively get a <i>different</i> power, and the entire course of history changes to reflect that."</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed, deep and mournful.</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I know, this sounds a bit absurd, but you have to trust me,"</i> the girl continued. <i>"I've been trying to stop this Endbringer fight from happening for, well, technically less than twenty minutes, but I've gone through a solid twenty powers for you so far, and we're running out of time. I just need you to tell me if you think your power can stop an Endbringer, and then if not, I'll keep searching."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">Now that he thought about it, Coil <i>did</i> remember getting a different power. He could remember both continuities perfectly: his normal power, the one he'd had up until a second ago, and the things he'd accomplished with it. And this new universe, where he'd gained the ability to create chairs out of thin air, the only downside being a strict Manton limitation (in a cruel twist of fate, the chairs had to be alive).</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">He blinked.</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">Then he created a chair, an expression of confusion on its face for the brief moment of its existence, and the entire world shifted. </p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">Another continuity - somehow, he still wasn't dead. An armband on his wrist was spelling out the deaths of the entire local Protectorate. He used his power, again, and the world shifted.</p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">A storm surged towards him. The world shifted.</p></a>

<a name="pg73"><p class="content-paragraph">An aerial view, drone provided, showed him the destruction of half of downtown; he quickly read his notes: <i>beetle - no powers, not sure why tattletale wanted to make her an undersider</i>. The world shifted.</p></a>

<a name="pg74"><p class="content-paragraph">A near death scenario. A frantic Tattletale, begging him to discard 'this' timeline. A Taylor with Tinker powers, ineffectively launching water bullets at Leviathan. <i>Another</i> near death scenario, <i>another</i> frantic Tattletale. Blaster Taylor, teaming up with a Ward from some other city to deal actual damage to Leviathan, before being shredded by water blades. <i>Another</i> frantic Tattletale.</p></a>

<a name="pg75"><p class="content-paragraph">Then, suddenly, a world where everything seemed somehow <i>quiet</i>. Here, Coil wasn't wearing a wrist band, but he had his phone. His notes were encrypted differently in this continuity, but he figured out the password easily enough; '<i>coilisthegreatest</i>' indeed.</p></a>

<a name="pg76"><p class="content-paragraph">This world had a fully functioning Undersiders, made vastly more effective by one 'Magic Swarm' ('Swarm' for short, apparently). Seemingly limitless power, mixed with naive teenage interests, had apparently made Coil into the backer of the greatest parahuman force on the West Coast.</p></a>

<a name="pg77"><p class="content-paragraph">This was a fight he simply <i>had</i> to see. Coil darted out of the room he'd found himself in - some side room in his underground base, for whatever reason. A lift ride and change later, and he was out on the streets...</p></a>

<a name="pg78"><p class="content-paragraph">Where people were celebrating.</p></a>

<a name="pg79"><p class="content-paragraph">He checked his phone. It was already over: Swarm had demolished Leviathan in minutes. Videos posted on social media sites showed esoteric energy blazing through the air, pixelated white-red chains covering the Endbringer.</p></a>

<a name="pg80"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd won. He'd beaten an Endbringer, by himself. And he'd missed all the action.</p></a>

<a name="pg81"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg82"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil watched the sunset at a distance, the sounds of festivity still ongoing.</p></a>

<a name="pg83"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd done it. He'd defeated an Endbringer, and not a single person knew it was him.</p></a>

<a name="pg84"><p class="content-paragraph">He was the greatest hero in the history of Brockton Bay... and nobody would ever know.</p></a>

<a name="pg85"><p class="content-paragraph">Unless... unless he used his power again. Could he find a better resolution?</p></a>

<a name="pg86"><p class="content-paragraph">No, he was done. This was it for Coil. There was no greater fight; Coil knew when to cut his losses. He had better things to do, anyways.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-15.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-17.html">Next</a></b></p>

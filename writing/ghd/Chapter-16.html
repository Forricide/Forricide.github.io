<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">An Endbringer was here.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Here, in Brockton Bay.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">What were the odds? Surely, a fraction of a percent. There were hundreds of other cities on Earth - thousands, even. Coil's luck, he determined, was astronomically low, that an Endbringer fight would be taking place here.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Endbringer fights.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">Events that attracted the strongest, most powerful, bravest, and least intelligent parahumans. Although Coil had (obviously) always matched the first three descriptors, the last one hadn't quite fit, so he'd never even considered attending.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">It was said that, on average, only one in four capes would survive each fight. Coil had taken that statistic, and done the intensive analysis of realising that twenty-five percent was a <i>very high</i> likelihood of death.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, the beasts had come for <i>his</i> city. He didn't even have to know which one it was, to know what the likely result was: the loss of most of his minions, the utter annihilation of all his plans, the ruination of his company. And, he supposed, the deaths of several hundred thousand people, who would no longer support his day job (indirectly) through their taxes.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">The time had come to make a stand.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">It was time for an Endbringer to be pushed back, defeated by new blood, by human ingenuity and force of will.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">Time for a victory for humanity, and an end to fear, intimidation, and weakness!</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">It was a shame he wouldn't be able to watch, as he'd immediately grabbed a car to get out of the city.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, he'd attempted to do so.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Are you kidding me?" said Coil.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">Just meters away from the front of the car, swaths of citizens streamed across the road. Some shouting, others with tears streaking down their eyes, others frantically making phone calls or texts.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"This is a nightmare. The citizens are supposed to go to the shelters - why're they all on the streets?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver did not respond.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"Not only that! Have these people heard of sidewalks? I don't pay taxes every year for these people to damage my perfect asphalt with their dirty feet!"</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver tapped the steering wheel once, surveying the flood of pedestrians.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're not even listening, are you, Dinah?"</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">She tapped the steering wheel again, then turned back. "I must focus on driving. There are too many people."</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's just what I was saying!" Coil exclaimed. "Too many people. Frankly, I wouldn't even be upset if they died to an Endbringer. They deserve it."</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">Dinah opened her mouth, presumably to respond, when someone knocked on the car window.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">It was him. His muscles rippled underneath contoured armour; his jawline almost shimmered in the sunlight. Majestic in person, almost as Coil himself had described the man.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil brought down his window. "Armsmaster! What can I do for you today?"</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"It is dangerous to be driving here," the man spoke. "Please step out of the car and take your daughter to a shelter on foot."</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">It was hard to argue with six feet of power armour, so Coil complied, opening his car door.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"I understand now," Armsmaster said, as Coil stepped into the light, still clad in his costume. "You're a cape. You were trying to take her to a shelter as fast as possible, in order to make it to the resistance in time. Do not worry: I will accompany you there." </p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, well-" Coil tried.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"I will take you on my motorcycle," Armsmaster said, as he guided Dinah to the entrance of an inconveniently close Endbringer shelter. "We will make it on time." </p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">Try as he might, Coil simply couldn't resist. After all, it was an excellent opportunity to collect material for his next tinker-tech based cape fic. He could hardly pass <i>that</i> up.</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil didn't pay attention during Legend's opening speech. It was, as he'd imagined, sappy and melodramatic. It wasn't like <i>he</i> would die here, after all. He apparently had a solid seventy-five percent chance of survival, which was a satisfyingly high number.</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil split again, then looked around in both realities. Unfortunately, the city was still being destroyed by Endbringer. That was another strike. He collapsed the worlds into one, then went to split again.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">Nothing happened.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Hm, that's odd,</i> thought Coil, as his cellphone continued ringing. <i>I could have sworn my power worked just three seconds ago.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">He tried again - once, twice. No luck.</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">With a heavy sigh, he pulled the phone out of his pocket. "<i>Yes</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Ah, Coil, just the man I was looking for."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">He groaned. "Tattletale, get to the point."</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Actually, it's Ms. Wilborn to you, thank you very much. And I'm here with my... fascinating friend, who wants to speak with you."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Whatever,</i> Coil thought, <i>none of this will have happened soon, once I figure out what's wrong with my power.</i> "Put them on, then."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes, uh, hello? I hold it like this, right?" </p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale's voice came through faintly: <i>"Yes, just speak into that microphone at the bottom. Yes, the little grates. No, it's fine, it'll pick you up."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Uh, yes, hello. This is... it doesn't matter,"</i> they continued. <i>She</i> continued. Coil shivered. There was something oddly terrifying in her voice. <i>"What matters is, Coil, I have a power that will, with your cooperation, be able to stop the Endbringer... or prevent him from showing up in the first place."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">"Go on."</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"My power is - and you'll have to take my word for it - that every time I kill a bug, you retroactively get a <i>different</i> power, and the entire course of history changes to reflect that."</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">"I know, this sounds a bit absurd, but you have to trust me," the girl said. "I've been trying to stop this Endbringer fight from happening for, well, technically only an hour, but I've gone through a solid twenty powers for you so far, and we're running out of time. I just need you to tell me if you think your power can stop an Endbringer, and then if not, I'll keep searching."</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">Now that he thought about it, Coil <i>did</i> remember getting a different power. He could remember both continuities perfectly: his normal power, the one he'd had up until a second ago, and the things he'd accomplished with it. And this new universe, where he'd gained the ability to create chairs out of thin air, the only downside being a strict Manton limitation (the chairs had to be alive). </p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">He blinked.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">Then he created a chair, and the entire world shifted. </p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil watched the sunset at a distance, the sounds of festivity still ongoing.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd done it. He'd defeated an endbringer, and not a single person knew it was him.</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">He was the greatest hero in the history of Brockton Bay... and nobody would ever know.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">Unless... unless he used his power again. Could he find a better resolution?</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-15.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-17.html">Next</a></b></p>

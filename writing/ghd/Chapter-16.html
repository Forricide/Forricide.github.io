<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Endbringer fights. Events that attracted the strongest, most powerful, bravest, and least intelligent parahumans. Although Coil had (obviously) always matched the first three descriptors, the last one hadn't quite fit, so he'd never even considered attending.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">It was said that, on average, only one in four capes would survive each fight. Coil had taken that statistic, and done the intensive analysis of realising that twenty-five percent was a <i>very high</i> likelihood of death.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, the beasts had come for <i>his</i> city. He didn't even have to know which one it was, to know what the likely result was: the loss of most of his minions, the utter annihilation of all his plans, the ruin of his company. And, he supposed, the deaths of several hundred thousand people, who would no longer support his day job (indirectly) through their taxes.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">The time had come to make a stand.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">The time for an Endbringer to be pushed back, defeated by new blood, by human ingenuity and force of will.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">The time for a victory for humanity, and an end to fear, intimidation, and weakness!</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">It was a shame he wouldn't be able to watch, as he'd immediately grabbed a car to get out of the city.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">At least, he'd attempted to do so.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">"Are you kidding me?" said Coil.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">Just meters away from the front of the car, swaths of citizens streamed across the road. Some shouting, others with tears streaking down their eyes, others frantically making phone calls or texts.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">"This is a nightmare. The citizens are supposed to go to the shelters - why're they all on the streets?"</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver did not respond.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Not only that! Have these people heard of sidewalks? I don't pay taxes every year for these people to damage my perfect asphalt with their dirty feet!"</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">His driver tapped the steering wheel once, surveying the flood of pedestrians.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're not even listening, are you, Dinah?"</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-15.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

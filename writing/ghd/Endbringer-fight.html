<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil split again, then looked around in both realities. Nope, city still being destroyed by Endbringer. That's another strike. He collapsed the worlds into one, then went to split again.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Nothing happened.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Hm, that's odd,</i> thought Coil, as his cellphone continued ringing. <i>I could have sworn my power worked just three seconds ago.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">He tried again - once, twice. No luck.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">With a heavy sigh, he pulled the cellphone out of his pocket. "<i>Yes</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, Coil, just the man I was looking for." </p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">He groaned. "Tattletale, get to the point."</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"Actually, it's Ms. Wilborn to you, thank you very much. And I've made a... fascinating friend, who wants to speak with you." </p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Whatever,</i> Coil thought, <i>none of this will have happened soon, once I figure out what's wrong with my power.</i> "Put them on, then."</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes, uh, hello? I hold it like this, right?" </p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale's voice came through faintly: "Yes, just speak into that microphone at the bottom. No, it's fine, it'll pick you up."</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">"Uh, yes, hello. This is... it doesn't matter," they continued. <i>She</i> continued. Coil shivered. "What matters is, Coil, I have a power that will, with your cooperation, be able to stop the Endbringer... or prevent him from showing up in the first place."</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Go on."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">"My power is - and you'll have to take my word for it - that every time I kill a bug, you retroactively get a <i>different</i> power, and the entire course of history changes to reflect that."</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">"I know, this sounds a bit absurd, but you have to trust me," the girl said. "I've been trying to stop this Endbringer fight from happening for, well, technically only an hour, but I've gone through a solid twenty powers for you so far, and we're running out of time. I just need you to tell me if you think your power can stop an Endbringer, and then if not, I'll keep searching."</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">Now that he thought about it, Coil <i>did</i> remember getting a different power. He could remember both continuities perfectly: his normal power, the one he'd had up until a second ago, and the things he'd accomplished with it. And this new universe, where he'd gained the ability to create chairs out of thin air, the only downside being a strict Manton limitation (the chairs had to be alive). </p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">He blinked.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Then he created a chair, and the entire world shifted. </p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil watched the sunset at a distance, the sounds of festivity still ongoing.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd done it. He'd defeated an endbringer, and not a single person knew it was him.</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">He was the greatest hero in the history of Brockton Bay... and nobody would ever know.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Unless... unless he used his power again. Could he find a better resolution?</p></a></body>

<p>Every time Coil split the universe, split fate, he also split his mind. Two brains thinking in what <i>should</i> have been parallel, but thanks to his immense genius, he was more than capable of diverging completely and thinking twice as much as normal. Lesser mortals would surely pale at the feats of intellect he was able to pull off: on one of his more inspired days, he'd successfully infiltrated the PRT not once, not twice, but <i>seven</i> times. It was true that each of these times, he had entered with his fully cleared civilian identity, but that hardly diminished the achievement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these circumstances were such that even his most focused mind working at double speed wasn't enough to fully comprehend the current state of events.</p>

<p>"You're telling me that they're <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yessiree. Done and dusted, as me mom used to say." </p>

<p>Before responding, Coil checked the caller information. <i>Cody Briggs</i>. It looked like somebody was receiving a pay cut. It was important to be perfectly respectful towards the greatest and most brilliant parahuman in the entirety of Brockton Bay. Also, he had the best hair, even if he'd woken up to find his mohawk mysteriously gone, and (somehow) replaced by a ratty fedora.</p>

<p>"Riddle me this, Bridges. If they're dead, then how is it that just yesterday, Tattletale herself briefed me on the results of the Lung encounter?"</p>

<p>"Dunno what to tell ya, boss. You saw the footage yesterday, nuttin' new since then."</p>

<p>Coil leaned forward over his desk. "...the footage?"</p>

<p>"Yessir! The one I showed to ya yesterday, caught it with Leet's magic ball doo-dad thingy."</p>

<p>Could Bridges know that Coil was watching- <i>no, that would be ridiculous.</i> "Which footage, Bridges?"</p>

<p>"Ya don't remember, boss?" </p>

<p>Ah, there it was. "Bridges, boy, do you know how much footage my usel- er, minions send me to watch every day?"</p>

<p>"Uh, a lot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bridges. A very large amount. And most of it is completely uninformative. So tell me, Bridges, what footage did'ya send me?" <i>Patience, Calvert.</i></p>

<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. "I sent it to ya on the big-ol' information highway, bossman. Internet mail with the subject, er, 'Shocking footage inside! Must watch! NSFL'. That ring a bell?"</p>

<p>Coil sighed and hung up the phone. Surprisingly, the email was indeed in his inbox, and marked as read. <i>Probably just an anti-spam measure.</i> </p>

<p>He clicked on the video attachment and pressed <b>play</b>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A figure, lying prone on a dilapidated building, was watching the street below. They were wearing a leather jacket, a cowboy hat, and a gas mask. A strange combination. The mask was, at least, understandable in Brockton Bay - the streets never smelled particularly pleasant.</p>

<p>Although roof-sitting was, as far as Coil was aware, a common pastime for the plebeian population of Brockton Bay, this particular peasant appeared to have a different reason entirely for their penchant for patient purview. Just in frame, in the streets below, an unfortunately quite recognizable Asian gang leader was visible, speaking with several men who were presumably his subordinates.</p>

<p>The camera's microphone was apparently just good enough to pick up snippets of the conversation. It was Lung, speaking in a fairly calm tone of voice, as if discussing the weather: "...the children, just shoot.  Doesn't matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot-" </p>

<p>Coil muted the speakers. Now <i>that</i> was quite unpleasant to listen to. Killing children just went too far. Besides the minor ethical considerations, it was just plain wasteful - children could be useful, but generally weren't as corpses. </p>

<p>Still, if what Goot had told him was true, things were only going to get worse from here.</p>

<p>Lung continued gesturing for a few seconds, then turned away as if to leave. </p>

<p>The person lying on the roof stood up slowly, dusting themselves off. Then, before Lung had taken even a single step, they jumped off the roof and down below, the camera sweeping forward to follow their path.</p>

<p>As Coil unmuted the audio, the street below came into view. And, to his surprise, so did a gigantic horse that appeared to have just been waiting there in a right turn lane. He watched with mixed emotions as the masked person fell directly into sitting position on the horse. <i>Ouch</i>, Coil thought, <i>that's got to hurt.</i></p>

<p>Lung had, evidently, not noticed the horse or its rider before. He spun around faster than his subordinates, guns appearing in hands.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>That deep, booming voice sent shivers down Thomas' spine. Not the good ones, either. He'd been fried alive a few times by Lung, and yet he'd never quite gotten used to it.</p>

<p>"Me? Just a new fella lookin' for some action, partner," the rider responded. "Y'all aren't gettin' away with this one!"</p>

<p>()</p>

<p><i>What did I just witness?</i> </p>

<p>None of this made sense. None of this made <i>any sense</i> at all. Coil almost considered calling back that half-wit he'd spoken with, Loda Bridges or whatever his name was. Almost.</p>

<p>Instead, he looked at his desk, and noticed a folder that he hadn't before. Unmarked, it contained several sheets of paper, each covered in notes. A rather familiar style of notes.</p>

<p>Tattletale's analysis. Even in death, she was useful.</p>

<p><i>people from all over city experiencing linguistic changes, new habits -> wide-range power</i></p>

<p><i>no demands made, no news -> possibly unintentional or unconscious power use</i></p>

<p><i>subject has unconscious power to make city more like country western movie</i></p>

<p><i>time-wise, change occurs right after incident at Mediocrity High</i></p>

<p><i>student likely culprit, gained cowboy-shaker powers due to love of Westerns</i></p>

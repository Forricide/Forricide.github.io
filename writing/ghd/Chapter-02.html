<p>Every time Coil split the universe, split fate, he also split his mind. Two brains thinking in what <i>should</i> have been parallel, but thanks to his immense genius, he was more than capable of diverging completely and thinking twice as much as normal. Lesser mortals would surely pale at the feats of intellect he was able to pull off: on one of his more inspired days, he'd successfully infiltrated the PRT not once, not twice, but <i>seven</i> times. It was true that each of these times, he had entered with his fully cleared civilian identity, but that hardly diminished the achievement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these peculiar circumstances were such that even his most focused mind working at double throughput wasn't enough to fully comprehend the current state of events.</p>

<p>"You're telling me that they're <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yessiree. Done and dusted, as me mom used to say, 'fore she bit the bullet." </p>

<p>Before responding, Coil checked the caller information. <i>Cody Briggs</i>. It looked like somebody was receiving a pay cut. It was important to be perfectly respectful towards the greatest and most brilliant parahuman in the entirety of Brockton Bay. Also, he had the best hair, even if he'd woken up to find his mohawk mysteriously gone, and (somehow) replaced by a ratty fedora.</p>

<p>"Riddle me this, Bridges. If they're dead, then how is it that just yesterday, Tattletale herself briefed me on the results of the Lung encounter?"</p>

<p>"Dunno what to tell ya, boss. You saw the footage yesterday, nuttin' new since then."</p>

<p>Coil leaned forward over his desk. "...the footage?"</p>

<p>"Yessir! The one I showed to ya yesterday, caught it with Leet's magic ball doo-dad thingy."</p>

<p>Could Bridges know that Coil used the Snitch to watch- <i>no, that would be ridiculous.</i> "Which footage, Bridges?"</p>

<p>"Ya don't remember, boss?" </p>

<p>Ah, there it was. <i>Disrespect</i>. Well, this was what Coil curated his 'Disposable Dimwits' list of employees for. "Bridges, boy, do you know how much data my usel- er, minions send me to review every day?"</p>

<p>"Uh, a big-ol' load?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bridges. A very large amount. And most of it is completely uninformative drivel. So tell me, Bridges, what footage did'ya send me?" <i>Patience, Calvert.</i></p>

<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. "I sent it t'ya on the good-ol' information highway, bossman. Internet mail with the subject, er, 'Shocking footage inside! Must watch! NSFL'. That ring a bell?"</p>

<p>Coil sighed and hung up the phone. Surprisingly, the email was indeed in his inbox, and already marked as read. <i>Probably just an anti-spam measure.</i> </p>

<p>He clicked on the video attachment and pressed <b>play</b>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A figure, lying prone on the roof of a dilapidated building, was watching the street below. They were wearing a leather jacket, a cowboy hat, and a gas mask. <i>A strange combination</i>, Coil mused. The mask was understandable in Brockton Bay - the streets never smelled particularly pleasant - but the other parts of their costume was almost taken out of an old Western movie.</p>

<p>Although roof-sitting was, as far as Coil was aware, a common pastime for the plebeian population of Brockton Bay, this particular peasant appeared to have a different reason entirely for their penchant for patient perception. Just in frame, down in the streets below, an unfortunately quite recognizable Asian gang leader was visible, speaking with several men who were presumably his subordinates.</p>

<p>The camera's microphone wasn't amazing, but as Coil jacked up the volume, the conversation became audible. It was Lung, speaking in a fairly calm tone of voice, as if discussing the weather: "...the children, just shoot.  Doesn't matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot-" </p>

<p>Coil muted the speakers. Now <i>that</i> was quite unpleasant to listen to. Killing children just went too far! Besides the minor ethical considerations, it was just plain wasteful - children could be useful, but generally weren't as corpses. </p>

<p>Still, if what Goot had told him was true, things were only going to get worse from here.</p>

<p>Lung continued gesturing for a few seconds, then turned away as if to leave. </p>

<p>The person lying on the roof stood up slowly, dusting themselves off. Then, before Lung had taken even a single step, they jumped off the roof and down below, the camera sweeping forward to follow their path.</p>

<p>As Coil unmuted the audio, the street below came into view. And, to his surprise, so did a gigantic horse that appeared to have just been waiting there in a right turn lane. Coil watched with mixed emotions as the masked person fell directly into sitting position on the horse. <i>Ouch</i>, he thought, <i>that's got to hurt.</i></p>

<p>Lung had, evidently, not noticed the horse or its rider previously. He spun around faster than his subordinates, guns appearing out of nowhere.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>That deep, booming voice sent shivers down Thomas' spine. Not the good ones, either. He'd been fried alive a few times by Lung, and yet he'd never quite gotten used to it.</p>

<p>"Me? Just a new fella lookin' for some action, partner," the rider responded. "Y'all aren't gettin' away with this one!"</p>

<p>Lung shrugged, and gestured at his minions, who started firing almost before the gesture was complete.</p>

<p>For all their flair, the rider didn't appear to be ready for gunfire. Well, at least, their horse wasn't - instead of putting up any kind of fight, it bucked sharply in fright, turned around, and galloped straight away from the gangsters, with its rider barely hanging on.</p>

<p>It looked like Lung considered chasing for a moment, then decided against it. The camera followed him, from a distance, as he made his rendezvous with Oni Lee.</p>

<p>Coil stopped the video before all of the Undersiders died.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p><i>What did I just witness?</i> </p>

<p>None of this made sense. None of this made <i>any sense</i> at all. Coil almost considered calling back that half-wit he'd spoken with, Loda Bridges or whatever his name was. Almost.</p>

<p>Instead, he looked at his desk, and noticed a folder that he hadn't seen before. Unlabelled, it contained several sheets of paper, each covered in notes. A rather familiar style of notes.</p>

<p>Tattletale's analysis. Even in death, she was useful.</p>

<p><i>people from all over city experiencing linguistic changes, new habits -> wide-range power in effect</i></p>

<p><i>no demands made, no public appearance, nothing in news -> possibly unintentional or unconscious power use</i></p>

<p><i>personality/etc changes different person to person -> somehow based off person themselves</i></p>

<p><i>-> subject has unconscious power to make other nearby people (-> range?) want to imitate western movies, generally quite poorly</i></p>

<p><i>-> time-wise, change occurs right after incident at Mediocrity High</i></p>

<p><i>-> student is likely culprit, gained cowboy-shaker powers due to love of Westerns + shaker flavour seems to come from isolation/fear</i></p>

<p>Well, that would explain the call with Cobra Brinks (or whatever his name was). Thomas groaned, mask off, rubbing his forehead. This was starting to give him a headache.</p>

<p>He had just the solution.</p>

<p>Splitting into new timelines, he reached out for -</p>

<p>The folder was gone.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't quite right. In both timelines, the folder was still there. But it was closed, had a flower design on the outside, and was sitting about a foot further back than he'd thought.</p>

<p>In other words, the folder he'd been using was gone, but a new one had spontaneously taken its place.</p>

<p><i>Huh,</i> Thomas thought, <i>that's never happened before.</i></p>

<p>In one timeline, he finally cracked, pulling out a twelve pack from the mini fridge in his desk.</p>

<p>In the other, he tentatively reached out and took hold of the folder. He was ready for anything - for the notes to start talking, or the folder to try and escape, or even for it to contain a pair of winning lottery tickets. Well, he wasn't really prepared for the last one, actually.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p><i>Of course,</i> Thomas thought. <i>It's just a folder, after all.</i></p>

<p>He opened the folder, and a gigantic mechanical clown head popped out, slamming into his face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Thomas screamed, in a low and very masculine voice. "What in the..?"</p>

<p>Examination of the clown head showed nothing out of the normal, other than the fact that it - upon being placed back into the folder - seemed to compress itself into a flat shape. Otherwise, he failed to find anything out of the ordinary about the... giant clown head.</p>

<p>Setting the space-warping device aside, Coil took a look at the notes inside the folder themselves. These notes were much briefer than the last set, written in large cursive instead of shaky print.</p>

<p><i>I was right (again) about the trigger at Windowless High.</i></p>

<p><i>Looks like the student gained some kind of justice-based powers due to being bullied, with a tinker flavour that generally comes from isolation/fear</i></p>

<p><i>my power seems to think the Lung confrontation shows that they want to form a</i></p>

<p><i>Okay, they've found me and want to be friends and start something called 'The Avengers'. Great! You can take this as my loathful resignation. They asked me to send you these notes anyways so you'd understand not to try and interfere, although I doubt it'll make it through to your thick, water-filled sku</i></p>

<p><i>Okay, that's that then. Enjoy the gift, courtesy of my new friend! Adios, fuc</i></p>

<p><i>Adios, loser.</i></p>

<p>Coil groaned. This didn't bode well.</p>

<p>Thankfully, he could (barely) remember his high school science classes. In order to understand a strange phenomenon, it was advisable to first form one or multiple hypotheses, then pay little Jimmy MacAdders for the solutions to the rest of the assignment.</p>

<p>No, wait, that wasn't right. </p>

<p>Hypotheses, then tests to confirm. <i>Power testing</i>. Coil grinned. Now this was something he could sink his teeth into.</p>

<p>He drained the last can of beer in his other timeline, then closed it. No time like the present, as his father used to say.</p>

<p>Coil put on his mask, took a deep breath, and split reality.</p>

<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas was having a very bad day.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">He wasn't sure when, exactly, it had started. Was it ten minutes ago, when he received a phone call from one of his subordinates? Or this morning, when he'd woken up from a terrible nightmare about being eaten alive by thirty-eight-point-seven hamsters? Or, was it at exactly oh-zero hours, by virtue of that being when the day had actually started?</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">No, wait, that last one was wrong. He was taking things too literally again. He didn't want to have to make another appointment with his psychologist. <i>Breathe, Calvert. Just breathe. Everything will be all right.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Everything was not all right.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">It was hard to say what he'd done wrong. Sure, he'd had the Undersiders (that brutish group of petty criminals he did his best to avoid publicly associating with) raid some casino, a few weeks back. It hadn't been a bad idea - anyone would agree! Well, it's not like Thomas had done a poll of popular opinion prior to having the robbery carried out, but he'd seen plenty of cape fiction online featuring casino heists, so it couldn't have been that uncommon of a concept.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">Had he expected the casino attack to piss off Lung, the local respiratory system aficionado that also happened to run one of Brockton Bay's largest gangs?</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, not really, no.</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Thomas, wasn't that casino in the middle of Lung's poorly-named gang's territory?</i> asks the intrepid reader, referring to a fact-checking wiki page they keep open in a pinned tab.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">That was true. And, admittedly, Thomas <i>knew</i> he should have seen this coming. He'd just been so focused on finding a skilled ex-military mercenary to teach a sensitivity training class, that he'd barely considered saving a backup reality for its prospective students. If he'd managed to keep his other reality - Booze, of course - open for a little longer, he might have found out that the most powerful parahuman in the entire city was hunting his patron gang. As it was, an unfortunate (but, in retrospect, quite predictable) bout of kidney failure had led to him closing Booze, leaving him with only the reality where he had never ingested a single pint.  </p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">That reality happened to also be the one where a fire-breathing pseudo-immortal dragon was hunting his four subcontracted super-henchmen. Unlike his regular henchmen, they were far less disposable, almost vital to his short-term plans.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">As it was, he wasn't sure if he'd made the wrong decision. He did know someone living with kidney failure, and he didn't envy them.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, actually, he did, just a little. But that didn't really have anything to do with the entire kidney failure thing.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">Regardless, he was now living with consequences that felt almost equally bad for his health. The Undersiders, a gang he'd brought together virtually through his own willpower (and large amounts of illicit money) were likely going to die today. </p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">In both of the realities he was existing in, Lung was on a warpath. The man was an unstoppable force - at least, Thomas certainly didn't have any countermeasures to a half-dragon on a rampage.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Although Lung did owe Coil a favour for the <i>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</i> subscription that Coil had gifted him last Halloween, it would be self-defeating to show his hand as a benefactor of the Undersiders. (Keeping that kind of association a secret was, in fact, an oft-repeated tip in <i>Supervillains for Dummies</i>) Besides, he was hoping to leverage that into getting Lung to change his gang's name to something more palatable.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">No, all Coil could realistically do was attempt to use his power from a distance to shift the odds away from that eventuality of <i>'Lung destroys everything, including Thomas' hopes and dreams'</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">So today, he would be playing a heavy part in fate. Although fire might have been Lung's domain, <i>destiny</i> itself was Coil's, and here he would be moulding it to his whims. Twisting fate with a vengeance... a mildly sleep-deprived vengeance, perhaps, but a vengeance nonetheless.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Yes, this called for pulling out all the stops.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">He had already abandoned the Alpha reality. In it, he had asked the Undersiders (through Tattletale, who he'd made the mistake of using as a liaison) to attempt an ambush on Lung.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">This had not gone well.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">He split fate in twain once again, giving a quiet yet maniacal laugh. It was time to go all-out. In one reality, he pulled open the left drawer of his desk; the other, the right.</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">In <i>Beer</i>, he closed his hand around a chilled can of some off-brand crap.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">But for <i>Alcohol</i>, only the finest vintage of wine would do.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">In one, he phoned Tattletale, mildly intoxicated but in a far better frame of mind.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"What's up, boss?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"I need you to - <i>urp</i> - instruct the other Undersiders to circle back. Oni Lee is waiting for you, ah, he's set up a trap."</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Shit, that's- wait, hold on, are you</i> drunk<i>?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Whoops,</i> thought Thomas.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">He closed <i>Beer</i>, then split reality again instantly. Thankfully, he'd only had a little bit to drink. If he really thought about it, this way was even better, as he was able to doubly enjoy the wine, unlike the average mere mortal who could only do so once.</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">Wait. Wasn't this the prohibitively expensive bottle he had been keeping to only the realities he closed, so that he'd never run out?</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas looked down at the bottle in his hand, already a quarter empty. An odd sound emanated from his stomach.  </p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">"...ah, damn it."</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">His phone rang in both realities, a moment before he had been planning to throw his wineglass at the wall. In one, he went through with the motion, watching dispassionately as the glass shattered, spilled wine disappearing into his already blood-red carpet. In the other, he masterfully transitioned the violent swing into a peaceful, measured picking-up of the receiver.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">"Tho-I mean, Coil speaking, how can I hel-I mean, who is this?"</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Listen Coil, I don't know what you're planning, but if you have anything up your sleeve, the time is</i> now, <i>Lung's after us and I think he brought Lee as backup. We're screwed if-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Whoa, Tats, what the hell is</i> that<i>?"</i> The voice in the background was faint, but still audible. Coil recognized it, unfortunately: Regent, another member of the Undersiders. He'd given himself the unfortunate task of <i>interviewing</i> the boy in some alternate realities, and although Regent had made an excellent fit for the Undersiders, Coil had happily sworn off ever interacting with him again.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I'm</i> busy <i>Regent, go ask Grue if you-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"No, seriously Tats, look - it's... is it</i> eating <i>him?!"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"What are you- okay, we need to deal with this."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, call me back?"</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">The girl on the other end of the line had already hung up.</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil let the realities coalesce, leaning back in his chair as the universe - <i>his</i> universe, really - realigned. This was where the hard work began. He made another fork in reality, then pressed down a button on his desk.</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas marvelled for a few seconds at the near-instant response time. This had been his <i>dream</i> since he was a child - sure, his own base was great, but a gigantic red button that did literally <i>anything</i> (of course, mostly illegal and/or horrifically immoral things) was most definitely the best idea he had ever come up with. Truly, his creativity knew no bounds.</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">"Potts. I need you to do something for me."</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Yes, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"The Undersiders have engaged with Lung at, ah," he paused, taking a moment to check the GPS tracker he'd installed in Tattletale's massive ego. "At four thirty-second and fifteenth. I need to know what's going on."</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"We have Jones and Schneider monitoring the scene, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Chug, chug.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">Finally putting down the can of beer, Thomas let out his biggest burp of the day. Arguably.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, is everything all right?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas wondered why there were any warnings about drinking this much. There was nothing wrong with <i>him</i>, after all. He felt great!</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, I need to know if-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">The Alcohol reality it was.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Bee-eeeep. "Sir?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">"Jones. What's going on? I need details."</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, this is - pardon my language - flippin' crazy. The situation has gotten entirely out of control, it's completely destroyed an entire city block, somehow it's got more laser turrets than a Star Destroyer, and we're lucky we haven't been hit in the crossfire. Just one minute ago, it fired some white bolt off that collapsed the entire warehouse due west of us, and the road literally melted along the bolt's travel path."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">"Slow down, slow down." Coil pressed the receiver to his ear. "You're telling me that Lung is firing <i>lasers</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"No! No, it's that new cape, sir. The one we talked about a few minutes ago?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas checked his short-term memory. Nope, no frantic discussions of surprise cape appearances there. A temporary lapse, he was sure, and <i>definitely</i> unrelated to his drinking habits. "Elaborate, Jones."    </p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"It's a gigantic robot of some sort, all decked out for war from the looks of it. Lung was about to fry the Undersiders like a nice meat n' vegetable sauté when it showed up."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">"They're still alive?"</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"S'far as I can tell, sir, nobody's even bruised. New cape's preaching loudly about peace and justice and nonviolence and such. Crazy if you ask me, sir. Not sure what this city's come to. What happened to good-old assassinations and war crimes? This is what technology does to our youth. Why, back in my day-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Jones</i>. What's happening right now? Give me the details. I need everything."</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Lung is taking heavy fire, sir. But he's not- no, wait, he's... Lung just went</i> down, <i>sir. And he's not getting up."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil put down his drink and gripped the phone receiver with two hands. This was remarkably counterproductive, considering the speaker was now covered, and he quickly went back to using just one hand. "What exactly happened, Jones? Are the Undersiders still there? Is anyone visibly hurt?"</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"After this new cape showed up, they just started pounding Lung into the ground, sir. It took them, oh - no more than five, ten minutes? As for the Undersiders, they're all fine, sir, so far as I can tell. Regrouping behind the new cape. Staring at Lung, just like me and Carl. It's a mesmerizing scene, for sure. I've not seen anything like it before. Lung's chest looks like Rip Van Winkle's - say, if he was tanning the whole time."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">The Undersiders had all survived, without any direct intervention from Coil? He'd somehow managed to pilot fate itself, cruel force that it was, into what had to be the sole eventuality where he succeeded. A feat no other could possibly have accomplished, Coil had pulled off while barely even trying.</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>He'd won!</i> Somehow, Coil had managed to set things up in just the perfect way. Not only had his underlings survived, he'd even single-handedly taken down a major thorn in his side at the same time. (As much as he enjoyed their biweekly poker games, Thomas was beginning to get annoyed with having to replace the fire-damaged chips each time.)</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, sure, maybe he hadn't been directly responsible. There was a degree of luck; he couldn't possibly have been able to know that a previously unknown and extremely powerful cape would have shown up just in time to save the day. But he <i>had</i> been drinking his lucky wine, and in his honest opinion, that merited a good fifty-one percent of the credit.</p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">The universe already merged in his mind, he split realities again and sat back, resting on his laurels in two worlds simultaneously. In his mind's eye, he could picture the Undersiders easily taking on the Protectorate, backed up by a fully-equipped tinker, doing anything they could to appease him. He would harness this new power, and the city would fall before his might, then the country, and then the world - except China, central Russia, Brazil, most of Africa, Australia, and that one territory in the eastern Czech Republic, of course.</p></a>

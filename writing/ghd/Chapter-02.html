<p>Thomas was having a very bad day.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure when, exactly, it had started. Was it ten minutes ago, when he had received a phone call from one of his subordinates? Or this morning, when he'd woken up from a terrible nightmare about being eaten alive by thirty-eight-point-seven hamsters? Or, was it at exactly oh-zero hours, by virtue of that being when the day had actually started?</p>

<p>No, wait, that last one was wrong. He was taking things too literally again. He didn't want to have to make another appointment with his psychologist. <i>Breathe, Calvert. Just breathe. Everything will be all right.</i></p>

<p>Everything was not all right. </p>

<p>It was hard to say what he'd done wrong. Sure, he'd had the Undersiders (that brutish group of petty criminals he did his best to avoid publicly associating with) raid a casino, a few weeks back. It hadn't been a bad idea - anyone would agree! Robbing a casino made for a fantastic criminal debut, and if you were clever with your choice of target, it could even grease the wheels of a comfortable working relationship with the IRS.</p>

<p>Had he expected the casino attack to piss off Lung, a local thug, gang leader, and respiratory system aficionado? </p>

<p>Well, no. </p>

<p><i>Thomas, wasn't that casino in the middle of Lung's poorly-named gang's territory?</i> you ask, referring to a fact-checking wiki page you keep open in a pinned tab.</p>

<p>That was true. And, admittedly, Thomas <i>knew</i> he should have seen this coming. He'd just been so focused on finding a skilled ex-military mercenary to teach a sensitivity training class, that he'd barely considered saving a timeline for its prospective students. If he'd managed to keep Booze, his second timeline, up for a little longer, he might have found out that the most powerful parahuman in the entire city was hunting his patron gang. As it was, an unfortunate (but, in retrospect, quite predictable) bout of kidney failure had led to him closing Booze, leaving him with only the timeline where he had never ingested a single pint. </p>

<p>But also the timeline where a fire-breathing pseudo-immortal dragon was hunting four henchmen that had a particular use to his plans, one of them being absolutely vital.</p>

<p>As it was, he wasn't sure if he'd made the wrong decision. He did know someone living with kidney failure, and he didn't envy them.</p>

<p>Well, actually, he did, just a little. But that didn't really have anything to do with the kidney failure.</p>

<p>However, now he was living with consequences that felt almost equally bad for his health. The Undersiders, a gang he'd brought together virtually through his own willpower (and large amounts of illicit money) were likely going to die today. </p>

<p>In both of his timelines, Lung was on a warpath. The man was an unstoppable force - at least, Thomas certainly didn't have any countermeasures to a half-dragon on a rampage. </p>

<p>Well, Lung did owe Coil a favour for the <i>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</i> subscription that Coil had gifted him last Halloween, but it would defeat the purpose to show his hand as a benefactor of the Undersiders. (Keeping that kind of association a secret was, in fact, an oft-repeated tip in <i>Supervillains for Dummies</i>)</p>

<p>No, all he could realistically do was attempt to use his power from a distance to shift the odds away from that eventuality of <i>Lung destroys everything, including Thomas' hopes and dreams</i>.</p>

<p>So today, he would be playing a heavy part in fate. Although fire might have been Lung's domain, <i>destiny</i> itself was Coil's, and he would be twisting it with a vengeance today.</p>

<p>Yes, this called for pulling out all the stops.</p>

<p>He had already abandoned timeline Alpha. In it, he had asked the Undersiders (through his liaison, the ever-frustrating Tattletale) to attempt an ambush on Lung.</p>

<p>This had not gone well.</p>

<p>He split fate again. It was time to go all-out. In one timeline, he pulled open the left drawer of his desk; the other, the right.</p>

<p>In timeline Beer, he closed his hand around a chilled can of some off-brand crap.</p>

<p>But for timeline Alcohol, only the finest vintage of wine would do.</p>

<p>In one, he phoned Tattletale, mildly intoxicated but in a far better frame of mind.</p>

<p><i>"What's up, boss?"</i></p>

<p>"I need you to - <i>urp</i> - instruct the other Undersiders to circle back. Oni Lee is waiting for you, ah, he's set up a trap."</p>

<p><i>"Shit, that's- wait, hold on, are you</i> drunk<i>?"</i></p>

<p><i>Whoops,</i> thought Thomas.</p>

<p>He closed Beer, then split reality again instantly. Thankfully, he'd only had a little bit to drink. If he really thought about it, this way was even better, as he was able to doubly enjoy the wine.</p>

<p>Wait. Wasn't this the bottle he had been keeping to only the timelines he closed, so that he'd never run out?</p>

<p>Thomas looked down at the bottle in his hand, already a quarter empty. His stomach made an odd sound.</p>

<p>"...ah, damn it."</p>

<p>His phone rang in both timelines, a moment before he had been planning to throw it at the wall, which was awfully convenient. In one, he went through with the motion, watching dispassionately as the glass shattered, spilled wine disappearing into his blood-red carpet. In the other, he masterfully transitioned the violent swing into a peaceful, measured picking-up of the receiver.</p>

<p>"Tho-I mean, Coil speaking, how can I hel-I mean, who is this?"</p>

<p><i>"Listen Coil, I don't know what you're planning, but if you have anything up your sleeve, the time is</i> now, <i>Lung's after us and I think he brought Lee as backup. We're screwed if-"</i></p>

<p><i>"Whoa, Tats, what the hell is</i> that<i>?"</i> The voice in the background was faint, but still audible. Coil recognized it, unfortunately: Regent, another member of the Undersiders.</p>

<p><i>"What- okay, we need to deal with this."</i></p>

<p>"Ah, call me back?"</p>

<p>The girl on the other end of the line had already hung up.</p>

<p>Coil let the timelines coalesce, leaning back in his chair. This was where the hard work began. He split timelines, then pressed down a button on his desk.</p>

<p><i>"Sir?"</i></p>

<p>Thomas marvelled for a few seconds at the near-instant response time. This had been his <i>dream</i> since he was a child - sure, his own base was great, but a gigantic red button that did literally <i>anything</i> (but, of course, mostly illegal and/or horrifically immoral things) was truly the best idea he had ever come up with.</p>

<p>"Potts. I need you to do something for me."</p>

<p><i>"Yes, sir."</i></p>

<p>"The Undersiders have engaged with Lung at, ah," he paused, taking a moment to check the GPS tracker he'd installed in Tattletale's massive ego. "At four thirty-second and fifteenth. I need to know what's going on."</p>

<p><i>"We have Goot and Schneider monitoring the scene, sir."</i></p>

<p><i>Chug, chug.</i></p>

<p><i>"Sir?"</i></p>

<p>Finally putting down the can of beer, Thomas let out his biggest burp of the day. Arguably.</p>

<p><i>"Sir, what are you doing?"</i></p>

<p>Thomas wondered why there were any warnings about drinking this much. There was nothing wrong with <i>him</i>, after all.</p>

<p><i>"Sir, I must know if-"</i></p>

<p>Timeline Alcohol it was.</p>

<p><i>Bee-eeeep. "Sir?"</i></p>

<p>"Goot. What's going on? I need details."</p>

<p><i>"Sir, this is - pardon my language - flippin' crazy. The situation has gotten entirely out of control, it's completely destroyed an entire city block, somehow it's got more laser turrets than a Star Destroyer, and we're lucky we haven't been hit in the crossfire. Just one minute ago, it fired some white bolt off that collapsed the entire warehouse due west of us, and the road literally melted along the bolt's travel path."</i></p>

<p>"Slow down, slow down. You're telling me that Lung is firing <i>lasers</i>?"</p>

<p><i>"No! No, it's that new cape, sir. The one we talked about a few minutes ago?"</i></p>

<p>Thomas checked his short-term memory. Nope, no frantic discussions of surprise cape appearances there. "Go on."</p>

<p><i>"It's a gigantic robot of some sort, all decked out for war from the looks of it. Lung was about to fry the Undersiders when it showed up."</i></p>

<p>"They're still alive?"</p>

<p><i>"S'far as I can tell, sir, nobody's even bruised. New cape's talking loudly about peace and justice and nonviolence and such. Crazy if you ask me, sir. Not sure what this city's come to."</i></p>

<p>"What's happening right now? Give me the details, Goot. I need everything."</p>

<p><i>"Sir, Lung is taking heavy fire, he's not- he's... Lung just went</i> down, <i>sir. And he's not getting up."</i></p>

<p>Coil put down his drink and gripped the phone receiver with two hands. "What exactly happened, Goot? Are the Undersiders still there? Is anyone visibly hurt?"</p>

<p>"They're all fine, sir, so far as I can tell. Regrouping behind the new cape. Staring at Lung, just like me and Carl. It's a mesmerizing scene, for sure, I've not seen anything like it before."</p>

<p>The Undersiders had all survived, without any direct intervention from Coil? He'd somehow managed to pilot fate itself, that cruel force, into what had to be the sole eventuality where he succeeded. A feat no other could possibly have accomplished, Coil had pulled off while barely even trying.</p>

<p><i>He'd won!</i> Somehow, Coil had managed to set things up in just the perfect way. Not only had his underlings survived, he'd single-handedly taken down a major thorn in his side at the same time. (As much as he enjoyed their biweekly poker games, Thomas was beginning to get annoyed with having to replace the fire-damaged chips each time.)</p>

<p>Well, sure, maybe he wasn't directly responsible. There was a degree of luck; he couldn't possibly have been able to know that a previously unknown and extremely powerful cape would have shown up just in time to save the day. But he <i>had</i> been drinking his lucky wine, and in his honest opinion, that merited a good fifty-one percent of the credit.</p>

<p>Alcohol closed, he split again and sat back, resting on his laurels in two universes simultaneously. In his mind's eye, he could picture the Undersiders easily taking on the Protectorate, backed up by a fully-equipped tinker, doing anything they could to appease him. The city would fall before his might, then the country, and then the world - except China, central Russia, Brazil, and that one territory in the eastern Czech Republic, of course.</p>

<p><i>Aha</i>, thought Calvert. <i>Things are looking up.</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Floating above the wreckage of an unfamiliar city, the young woman searched. She was late, in a sense; the city had been long destroyed, and it was unlikely she'd manage to find anything she needed.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Still, it was possible.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Squinting her eyes and channelling another ghost's powers, she suddenly made out a faint shape, like the receding echo of her quarry. Abnormal, it merited investigation.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">As she drew closer, she could make out more of the ghost. A man, in his late thirties or early forties, not angry in death: resigned, tired. Made more intriguing by the fact that he shouldn't exist - a glimmer that faint should have faded, several times over.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Glaistig Uaine collected the power, curious.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It wasn't a particularly complicated one, she learned. A precognitive power that could simulate two separate timelines.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Useful, perhaps, but she wasn't certain how much it would help her.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Before she sent it away, she considered if the power was worth using anyways. A bit of precognition was always valuable.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">So she activated it.</p>

<p><i>"It's Taylor Hebert, sir."</i></p>

<p>Thomas didn't move, phone still held up to his head, staring out over the city.</p>

<p>In his mind, it was at least mildly abnormal for callers to hang up after speaking four words. Moreso when those words had no apparent meaning. </p>

<p>He couldn't help but ask, regardless: Who, or what, was a <i>Taylor Hebert</i>? A night show host? A clothing brand? Some new children's toy?</p>

<p>A local celebrity? A political rival?</p>

<p>If only there was some way he could gain more information - context to the message, the identity of the caller.</p>

<p>A seagull flew by, briefly casting a shadow over Thomas' face.</p>

<p>Thomas checked the caller information.</p>

<p><i>Britters [Minion]</i></p>

<p>It was just enough to resurface a memory of his request, made when he still had an idea of what he was trying to accomplish: <i>"I only need a name, Britters."</i> </p>

<p>His henchman had actually come through. Thomas had that name he had been looking for - <i>Taylor Hebert</i>. Perhaps an unlucky teenager; but possibly a new parahuman, using their power to disrupt his. Thomas hadn't exactly held out hope that this was the answer he was looking for, but it was at least one avenue of research.</p>

<p>And, with any luck, he'd find the source of his frustrations.</p>

<p>He considered his options, stepping back from the edge of the roof. The early afternoon sun was starting to become uncomfortable. Barely paying attention to his surroundings, he reclaimed his suit jacket and made his way back inside.</p>

<p>He was still marvelling at how he'd been able to make it this long, with no chance for mental release since - he checked his watch - well, much more than twenty-four hours ago. Perhaps he <i>had</i> been getting a bit dependant on that. Oh well.</p>

<p>If he was going all-in, and working off the assumption that using his power again would erase things he'd done, he'd have to make his time before doing so count.</p>

<p>Did he call up Piggot to gloat? Push Assault off a skyscraper of above average height?</p>

<p>Well, they were both in the building below him. He wasn't sure where Assault would be, but he could easily find Piggot.</p>

<p>Thomas reentered the stairwell, taking stairs two at a time. Emily Piggot's office was two floors below the roof, and ensconced behind a protective layer of cubicles. Thomas strode past the plebeian office workers without a second thought, only stopping once he had entered the doorway of the director's questionably decorated office.</p>

<p>She looked up after a few long seconds. If he didn't know her facial expressions as well as he did from countless abandoned realities, he wouldn't have noticed the frown. "Calvert. What do you need?"</p>

<p>Thomas stared into her eyes, opened his mouth, realized he wasn't even sure what he wanted to say - and then stopped.</p>

<p>He could see the weary look in her eyes, the way her entire expression seemed to drag. Three days ago, she'd been (relatively) ecstatic. For a brief moment, he'd been able to see her happy, rejuvenated - a stark contrast to the woman he knew. Now, that energy was gone as quickly as it had come, sapped away by the daily grind of being responsible for this city. That same exhaustion he'd had a taste of, trying to manage even four incompetent superheroes.</p>

<p>He - no. This couldn't be. He was <i>empathizing</i> with her? That wasn't something he'd done since...</p>

<p>Thomas cut off that train of thought. Piggot was staring at him, seemingly on the verge of asking another question. He didn't want to hear it.</p>

<p>Frowning, Thomas used his power, praying to the disturbingly inconsistent gods of fate that he'd end up somewhere far away from that office.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>   </p>

<p>"You sure about this? He seems kinda like a loser. Uh, no offence."</p>

<p>In both realities, freshly synced, Coil sat at his desk, facing down three teenage girls. One of them he recognized in a heartbeat as Tattletale; the speaker, however, took a few more seconds... <i>Panacea?</i></p>

<p>"Trust me, Amy. I read Wor-<i>cough</i> er, I mean, I got my prophetic vision weeks ago." This one, presumably the leader, Coil didn't recognize. Brown hair (or was it black? He couldn't tell with the blasted fluorescent lighting) and taller than the other two, she projected a strange level of confidence considering she was facing down Brockton Bay's greatest supervillain in his own lair. "He's seriously an asshole. Besides, Lisuhhh- I mean, Tattletale agrees, right?"</p>

<p>Tattletale, for her part, seemed to have spaced out.</p>

<p>"Tats? You in there?" asked the girl with ambiguously coloured hair, waving a hand in front of her face.</p>

<p>"You <i>read</i>..." Tattletale murmured, barely audible. "An alternate dimension..? No. Something more... greater? No, this world <i>is a story</i>, you're <i>writing all of this</i>?"</p>

<p>"Now, look here Tattletale, if you keep down this path I'll have to edit this entire section out! Wait, fuck! I mean, maybe that's out of character... Is this breaking the fourth wall?"</p>

<p>"I'm just a character in a story?" shrieked Tattletale, flailing her arms. In his disoriented state, Coil found her movement reminiscent of a chicken with its head cut off. "Do you understand what this does to philosophy? To <i>theory of mind</i>? You've absolutely-"</p>

<p>Coil never found out what she was about to say, as he'd already merged the realities and reactivated his power.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>  </p>

<p>For years, Coil had used his unrestricted access to two worlds in a delicate manner. A reality could be a way to find some emotional release, gain information invisibly, or make high-reward plays with absolutely no risk. Over that time, his power had always necessitated a delicate balance. With exactly two realities, he had to meticulously plan each use to make sure he wouldn't have to close one reality early to get drunk. </p>

<p>But what could he do with <i>sixteen</i>?</p>

<p>In one universe, he drank tea with Lung, discussing the most recent edition of <i>Supervillain Seasonals</i> (<i>Illegal Teens: How to recruit youth for your gang</i>). Lung argued that the more impressionable everyday citizens were perfect targets for gang membership; Coil tried in vain to convince him that well-paid mercenaries were far better at following instructions. Lung balked at the thought of lowered profits; Coil insisted that Black Friday deals were great for mercenaries.</p>

<p>In another reality, he took in the sight that was his desk. One, two, four... <i>twenty-three</i> empty beer cans. An impressive run. He got up to use the washroom, drink still in hand.</p>

<p>Five more worlds were taken up with similar tasks; in some others, he sent his underlings out on moderately risky adventures.</p>

<p>Most of them seemed to be hilarious failures.</p>

<p>The less observant observer might wonder how Coil had ended up in this position. Had he been given a power-up from the heinous conspiracy that ruled the Earth from behind the scenes? Don't be silly, as if something like that would exist. Had he simply solved the riddle of powers himself, cracking their nature open to be profited from? As likely a future as that was, it hadn't happened here (yet).</p>

<p>In fact, Coil didn't even have the slightest idea how he'd ended up in this continuity, with all sixteen realities already created and ready to use. He hadn't done much since then, other than revel in being present in sixteen parallel universes; over the past day, he'd just barely started to get used to it. If he'd been apathetic to things before, well...</p>

<p>In one universe, he laughed at footage of the PRT building going up in flames. "This is great, Kerby! Do you think you can do the rig next week?"</p>

<p>"Sir, with all due respect, I think that-"</p>

<p>"That's great! Man, I'd kill to see Piggot's face right now. Literally."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but that would be easier if you hadn't ordered us to make her 'sleep with the fishes', sir."</p>

<p>"I'm a long term planner, Kerby. Don't undermine me here."</p>

<p>It was at that time that, in his most important reality, the phone finally rang.</p>

<p>"Butters, report," Coil said.</p>

<p><i>"It's Britters, sir."</i></p>

<p>"Britters, then. What do you have to report?"</p>

<p><i>"Well, sir, I've investigated the girl you mentioned - Taylor Hebert. Progress was rather slow, until I discovered a rather crucial piece of information."</i></p>

<p>Coil leaned back in his chair. "And what was that, Britters?"</p>

<p><i>"You recruited her a month ago, sir."</i></p>

<p>Coil made a note in reality 8, where his wrist was becoming increasingly sore. It seemed alcohol was not, in fact, a substitute for stretches.</p>

<p><i>searched-for parahuman already recruited - by me! how is it possible for one man to be this competent? have team Gamma investigate.</i></p>

<p>Out loud, he said: "That is quite convenient. Give me more details."</p>

<p><i>"Certainly, sir. It appears that she nearly died to Lung before the Undersiders saved her. Her power allows her to upgrade capes through an, er, strange ritual. Quite frankly, I'm not sure how or why she ended up fighting Lung in the first place. It seems like a rather unwise thing to do. It's possible that additional investigation would uncover more in that area."</i></p>

<p>Coil played with a flash drive on his desk. "I don't think that will be a problem. You've done marvellously here, Britters. Marvellously."</p>

<p><i>"Thank you, sir."</i></p>

<p>Making another note with his left hand in his eighth reality- which read 'give Britters a raise', or it would have, if it wasn't completely illegible - Coil ended the call in the current one.</p>

<p>He hadn't been entirely idle over the past days. No, with the power of sixteen Coil-sized brains (which, to clarify for the relatively dense reader, was already well above average) he'd been able to come to a fair few conclusions, based on previously-accumulated information. (It had taken a full day to reverse-engineer the messy notes the previous Coil of this continuity had created - perhaps he needed to start using a sober reality for notetaking.)</p>

<p>First, he was now quite certain that the activation of his power - specifically, when he <i>split</i> realities, not when he merged them - was the catalyst for the odd changes in continuity he'd been experiencing. Despite this confirmation, Coil still found the possibility baffling; the idea of a power being able to rewrite seemingly <i>anything</i> that had happened over the span of several weeks was mind-boggling. </p>

<p>Not that Coil's mind was particularly boggled. In fact, having sixteen times his normal cognitive capacity was rather effective in staying un-boggled. He did, however, presume that the average commoner's mind would be boggled by such a thing. Boggled to the tenth degree, as it were.</p>

<p>In the eighth parallel universe, Coil turned back one page in his notepad.</p>

<p>It was blank.</p>

<p>Hm, he must have forgotten to write the rest of the information down. Regardless, he could remember well enough. <i>The earliest difference between each continuity,</i> he wrote, <i>seems to be the trigger event of one Taylor Hebert</i>.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't entirely accurate. According to his past-self's notes, the trigger event - some boring, teenager-drama-laden situation he'd fallen asleep listening to the explanation of - always stayed the same, like a shockingly sturdy rock weathering the docile river of time. From that point, however, history rewrote itself each time he used his power: every split, that Hebert girl would end up triggering with a different power. And a bizarre one, too, more often than not.</p>

<p>The notes he'd found in this continuity from - well, the previous <i>him</i> - were more than enough to confirm that. One folder was dedicated to long-form write-ups on each of the previous alternate powers the <i>previous him</i> had encountered; it went along with an entire <i>binder</i> filled with ranting and raving about one in particular, where she'd directed invertebrates or something. There was an entire essay on his other self's miserable experiences with <i>bees</i>, of all things. Not something Coil could imagine himself ever writing, really. He saw himself as more of a calm, patient analyst. An analyst capable of purchasing bug spray (and, in rare cases, flamethrowers).</p>

<p>None of this really did much to settle the unease at wondering if he himself, just like the Coil whose notes he'd been reading through, would eventually be replaced by yet <i>another</i> version of himself. Or was that not how this sort of thing worked - would he be pushed to another continuity instead, suddenly displaced by an unknown alternate Coil? Or did the past Coil from this continuity not really exist, fabricated along with the entire continuity by his power?</p>

<p>There was no way for him to know, not unless he used his power enough times to eventually find a universe where he'd somehow acquired that information. This Coil, at least, was <i>done</i> trying to understand the full mechanics of what was going on. The fundamentals were more than enough.</p>

<p>Specifically, the fundamental truth that he was <i>never, ever</i> using his power again. </p>

<p>Sixteen realities! Sixteen beautifully crafted, perfectly separate, universes. Each connected by one great, universe-spanning being (i.e., Coil). Each providing a container for his immense genius, a vector for his majestic schemes, a tesseract of triumph.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he couldn't refresh them? No.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he'd already essentially wasted three on incredibly petty revenge? No!</p>

<p>Did anything really matter, in this cruel, bitter world?</p>

<p>Well, that remained to be seen. Coil was certainly starting to feel a bit more fatalistic, although that might have been the entire <i>experiencing sixteen universes simultaneously</i> thing.</p>

<p>In one sober universe, he went to go check on another project his past self (may they rest or continue existing in peace) had begun. In all sixteen worlds, he had access to one Dinah Alcott - a precognitive with powers to rival his. If not mental acuity.</p>

<p>"Alcott. How are you adjusting?"</p>

<p>The girl played with her mask, deep breathing sounds coming through what seemed to be an air filter at the bottom. Coil wasn't quite sure why; he had a very complex filtration setup already running for the underground base. It had been expensive, too. Most highly capable ex-military mercenaries didn't have HVAC degrees, apparently.</p>

<p>"Do not -" <i>hppph</i> "- denominate me by that peasant designation, lowling," she said, finally. "Refer to me as <i>Darth Cassandra</i>-" <i>hpppph</i> "- for I have become one with the dark facet of the force."</p>

<p>Coil paused.</p>

<p>"Ah, precognition, you mean. As a force for darkness. You've been reading ahead."</p>

<p>She shook her head curtly, but said nothing. </p>

<p><i>hpppph</i></p>

<p>Coil took a moment to look around the room. It had been barren only days ago, before he'd instructed Peters to assist his new charge in decoration. Now, the walls were painted a deep, dark blue, the floor was covered with a strange array of implements (why a frying pan?), and Alcott herself sat on a steel throne, which still only brought her to eye level with him.</p>

<p>A good start, really. <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i> had two whole chapters on training up a protégé, and Coil seemed to recall <i>evil throne room (slightly less evil and throne-y than yours)</i> being one of the later stages. He would know, too: he'd spent hours studying and reviewing those chapters when he initially came up with this plan.</p>

<p>Not that he'd needed to do so, of course. Coil excelled in everything, including training up successors. He had merely been cautious!</p>

<p><i>hppph</i> "Your attention... wanes."</p>

<p>Coil snapped back into reality. His new protégé was slouching forward in her throne, tapping her foot.</p>

<p>"What do you -" <i>hpppph</i> "want, lowling? I have little time for peasants such as you."</p>

<p><i>That is quite rude,</i> Coil thought. He wondered if he still had that workplace sensitivity instructor on retainer in this continuity. </p>

<p>"Well, I just thought a reminder was necessary, that I'll be tutoring you on concocting evil plots at two o'clock this afternoon. I hope you haven't forgotten."</p>

<p><i>hpph</i> "I will... deign to consider attendance."</p>

<p>"If you don't come, I will take away your thesaurus privileges," Coil said, quite reasonably.</p>

<p>The girl sat up straight. "I would raze your consortium to the ground from whence it materialized."</p>

<p>Coil politely left the room before breaking down into maniacal laughter.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>While waiting in his custom-built <i>instruction lounge</i> in one reality, Coil sat down in a chair in another. He was soon joined by Lung, the last of their group to arrive.</p>

<p>This was a new initiative Coil had put together specifically for this reality, in order to bring about a long-standing dream of his. It had never seemed realistic to do in the past - he closed and reopened realities far too frequently to carry out long-term plots - but with sixteen worlds that he couldn't really close, he figured this was his best chance.</p>

<p>Well, in this world he'd already burnt down the PRT building, so it wasn't like he had a job he could lose by wasting time anyways.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're all wondering why I've called you here today," Coil said.</p>

<p>Lung grunted with vague disinterest. Gregor silently stared at Coil. Newter, for his part, actually seemed to be paying attention; Labyrinth said nothing.</p>

<p>This was one of Coil's more expensive concepts. Faultline's Crew was usually out of his budget. Ah, well - money in a timeline that would never be real was meant to be spent, after all.</p>

<p>"We're going to play a game called <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>," he continued, when nobody said anything. "I'm thinking we can do a podcast of it. We'll be huge; think about it: where else can you play <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> with an actual dragon, and a bona fide dungeon master?"</p>

<p>Gregor started to speak, but fortunately, he was quite easy to cut off.</p>

<p>"We'll start it out with a simple setup. Newter, you'll be our rogue; Lung, I've written up an excellent Dragonborn backstory for you - Gregor, I don't really know what to do with you, Faultline threw you in as a freebie, I guess you can use a stock barbarian build... I will be a wizard, of course, second in intelligence to only our dungeon master: Labyrinth!"</p>

<p>For a moment, nobody at the table said anything, stunned into silence as they were by Coil's incredible concept.</p>

<p>Gregor said: "Labyrinth is rarely lucid. I do not think that this will work."</p>

<p>Lung grunted in what could be construed as assent.</p>

<p>"Dude, did you really hire us to play some game?" Newter asked. "I mean, I'm not gonna judge, but you know how much you're paying, right?"</p>

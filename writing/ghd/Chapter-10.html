<p>Thomas stared at his phone. </p>

<p>He'd answered after two rings, and that one sentence had been the only thing the speaker had said before hanging up. A prank call? Perhaps a wrong number?</p>

<p>He couldn't help but ask, regardless: Who, or what, was a <i>Taylor Hebert</i>? A pop show host? A clothing brand? Some new children's toy?</p>

<p>Thomas finally gave in, checking the caller information.</p>

<p><i>Britters [Minion]</i></p>

<p>It was just enough to resurface a memory of his request: <i>"I only need a name, Britters."</i></p>

<p>His henchman had actually come through. Thomas had the name he was looking for - with any luck, the source of his frustrations - and with it, free rein to abandon this godforsaken temporal continuity entirely. </p>

<p>He considered his options, stepping back from the edge of the roof. The early afternoon sun was starting to become uncomfortable; deep in thought, he reclaimed his suit jacket and made his way back inside.</p>

<p>Did he call up Piggot to gloat? Push Assault off a building of above average height? He was still marvelling at how he'd been able to make it this long, with no chance for mental release since - he checked his watch - well, much more than twenty-four hours ago. Perhaps he <i>had</i> been getting a bit dependant on that. Oh well.</p>

<p>Piggot's office was down two flights of stairs and across a large room of cubicles. He walked past the plebeian office workers without a second thought, only stopping once he had entered the doorway of the director's questionably decorated office.</p>

<p>"Calvert. What do you need?"</p>

<p>Thomas stared into her eyes, readied himself to dispense verbal justice, opened his mouth - and then stopped.</p>

<p>What was he doing? He could see the weary look in her eyes, the way her entire expression seemed to drag. That same exhaustion he'd had a taste of, trying to manage even four incompetent superheroes.</p>

<p>He - no. This couldn't be. He was <i>empathizing</i> with her? That wasn't something he'd done since...</p>

<p>Thomas cut off that train of thought. Piggot was staring at him, seemingly on the verge of asking another question. He didn't want to hear it.</p>

<p>Frowning, Thomas used his power, praying to the disturbingly inconsistent gods of fate that he'd end up somewhere far away from that office.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>"You sure about this? He seems kinda like a loser. Uh, no offence."</p>

<p>In both realities, he sat at his desk, facing down three teenage girls. One of them he recognized in a heartbeat as Tattletale; the speaker, however, took a few more seconds... <i>Panacea?</i></p>

<p>"Trust me, Amy. I read Wor-<i>cough</i> er, I mean, I got my prophetic vision weeks ago." This one, presumably the leader, Coil didn't recognize. Brown hair (or was it black? He couldn't tell with the blasted fluorescent lighting) and taller than the other two, she projected a strange level of confidence considering she was facing down Brockton Bay's greatest supervillain in his own lair. "He's seriously an asshole. Besides, Lisuhhh- I mean, Tattletale agrees, right?"</p>

<p>Tattletale, for her part, seemed to have spaced out.</p>

<p>"Tats? You in there?" asked the girl with ambiguously coloured hair, waving a hand in front of her face.</p>

<p>"You <i>read</i>..." Tattletale murmured, barely audible. "An alternate dimension..? No. Something more... greater? No, this world <i>is a story</i>, you're <i>writing all of this</i>?"</p>

<p>"Now, look here Tattletale, if you keep down this path I'll have to edit this entire section out! Fuck! I mean, is that breaking character?"</p>

<p>"I'm just a character in a story?" shrieked Tattletale, flailing her arms. "Do you understand what this does to philosophy? To <i>theory of mind</i>? This level of fourth-wall breaking, you've absolutely-"</p>

<p>Coil never found out what she was about to say, as he'd already activated his power.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>For years, Coil had used his unrestricted access to two worlds in a delicate way. A reality could be a way to find some emotional release, gain information invisibly, or make high-reward plays with absolutely no risk. All this time, his power had necessitated a delicate balance; with exactly two realities, he had to meticulously plan each use to make sure he wouldn't have to close one early to get drunk. </p>

<p>But what could he do with <i>sixteen</i>?</p>

<p>In one universe, he drank coffee with Lung, discussing the most recent edition of <i>Supervillain Seasonals</i> (<i>Illegal Teens: How to recruit youth for your gang</i>). Lung argued that the more impressionable everyday citizens were perfect targets for gang membership; Coil tried in vain to convince him that well-paid mercenaries were far better at following instructions.</p>

<p>In another reality, he took in the sight that was his desk. One, two, four... <i>twenty-three</i> empty beer cans. An impressive run. He got up to use the washroom, drink still in hand.</p>

<p>Five more worlds were taken up with similar tasks; in some others, he sent his underlings out on moderately risky adventures.</p>

<p>Most of them seemed to be hilarious failures.</p>

<p>The less observant observer might wonder how Coil had ended up in this position. Had he been given a power-up from the heinous conspiracy that ruled the Earth from behind the scenes? Don't be silly, as if something like that would exist. Had he simply solved the riddle of powers himself, cracking their nature open to be profited from? As likely a future as that was, it hadn't happened here.</p>

<p>In fact, Coil didn't even have the slightest idea how he'd ended up in this continuity, with all sixteen realities already created and ready to use. He hadn't done much since then, other than revel in being present in sixteen parallel universes; over the past two days, he'd already started to get used to it. If he'd been apathetic to things before, well.</p>

<p>In another universe, he laughed at footage of the PRT building going up in flames. "This is great, Kerby! Do you think you can do the rig next week?"</p>

<p>"Sir, with all due respect, I think that-"</p>

<p>"That's great! Man, I'd kill to see Piggot's face right now. Literally."</p>

<p>"That would be easier if you hadn't ordered us to make her 'sleep with the fishes', sir."</p>

<p>"I'm a long term planner, Kerby. Don't undermine me here."</p>

<p>It was at that time that, in his most important reality, the phone finally rang.</p>

<p>"Butters."</p>

<p>"It's Britters, sir."</p>

<p>"Britters, then. What do you have to report?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've investigated the girl you mentioned - Taylor Hebert. Progress was rather slow, until I discovered a rather crucial piece of information."</p>

<p>Coil leaned back in his chair. "And what was that, Britters?"</p>

<p>"You recruited her a month ago, sir."</p>

<p>Coil made a note in reality 8, where his wrist was becoming increasingly sore.</p>

<p><i>searched-for parahuman already recruited - by me! how is it possible for one man to be this competent? have team Gamma investigate.</i></p>

<p>Out loud, he said: "That is quite convenient."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir. It appears that she nearly died to Lung before the Undersiders saved her. Her power allows her to upgrade capes through a strange ritual. Quite frankly, I'm not sure how or why she ended up fighting Lung in the first place. It seems like a rather unwise thing to do. But, I'm sure additional investigation would uncover more in that area."</p>

<p>Coil played with a USB on his desk. "I don't think that will be a problem. You've done marvellously here, Britters. Marvellously."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Making a note with his left hand in his eighth reality- which read 'give Britters a raise', or it would have, if it wasn't completely illegible - Coil ended the call in the current one.</p>

<p>He hadn't been entirely idle over the past days. No, with the power of sixteen Coil-sized brains (which, to clarify, was well above average) he'd been able to come to a fair few conclusions, based on previously-accumulated information.</p>

<p>First, for some reason the activation of his power - specifically, when he <i>split</i> realities, not when he merged them - was the catalyst for the odd changes in continuity he'd been experiencing. Coil wasn't sure how this was possible; the idea of a power being able to rewrite literally <i>everything</i> that had happened over the span of more than a month was rather mind-boggling. </p>

<p>Not that Coil's mind was particularly boggled. In fact, having sixteen times his normal cognitive capacity was rather effective in staying un-boggled. He did, however, presume that the average plebeian's mind would be boggled by such a thing. Heavily boggled.</p>

<p>In the eighth parallel universe, he turned back one page in his notepad.</p>

<p>It was blank.</p>

<p>Hm, he must have forgotten to write the rest of the information down. Regardless, he could remember well enough. <i>The earliest difference between each continuity,</i> he wrote, <i>seems to be the trigger event of one Taylor Hebert</i>.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't entirely accurate. The trigger event - some boring, teenager-drama-laden situation he'd fallen asleep listening to the explanation of - always stayed the same, like a particularly sturdy rock in a wimpy flow of time. From that point, however, history rewrote itself each time he used his power: every split, that Hebert girl would end up triggering with a different power. And a bizarre one, too, more often than not.</p>

<p>The notes he'd found in this continuity from - well, the previous <i>him</i> - were more than enough to confirm that. One folder was dedicated to long-form write-ups on each of the previous alternate powers the <i>previous him</i> had encountered; it went along with an entire <i>binder</i> filled with ranting and raving about on in particular, where she'd directed invertebrates or something. There was an entire essay on his other self's miserable experiences with <i>bees</i>, of all things. Not something Coil could imagine himself ever writing, really. He saw himself as more of a calm, patient analyst. An analyst capable of purchasing bug spray.</p>

<p>None of this really did much to settle the unease at wondering if he himself, just like the Coil whose notes he'd been reading through, would eventually be replaced by yet <i>another</i> version of himself. Or was that not how this sort of thing worked - would he be pushed to another continuity instead, suddenly displaced by an unknown alternate Coil?</p>

<p>Well, there was no way for him to know, not unless he used his power enough times to eventually find a universe where he'd somehow acquired that information. This Coil, at least, was <i>done</i> trying to understand the full mechanics of what was going on. The fundamentals were more than enough.</p>

<p>Specifically, the fundamental truth that he was <i>never, ever</i> using his power again. </p>

<p>Sixteen realities! Sixteen beautifully crafted, perfectly separate, universes. Each connected by one great, universe-spanning being (i.e., Coil). Each providing a container for his immense genius, a vector for his majestic schemes.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he couldn't refresh them? No.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he'd already essentially wasted three on incredibly petty revenge? No!</p>

<p>Did anything really matter, in this cruel, bitter world?</p>

<p>Well, that remained to be seen. Coil was certainly starting to feel a bit more fatalistic, although that might have been the entire <i>experiencing sixteen universes simultaneously</i> thing.</p>

<p>In the current universe, he went to go check on another project his past self (that no longer was) had begun. In all sixteen worlds, he had access to one Dinah Alcott - a precognitive with powers to rival his. If not mental acuity.</p>

<p>"Alcott. How are you adjusting?"</p>

<p>The girl adjusted her mask, deep breathing sounds coming through what seemed to be an air filter at the bottom. Coil wasn't quite sure why; he had a very complex filtration setup already running for the underground base. It had been expensive, too. Most highly capable ex-military mercenaries didn't have HVAC degrees, apparently.</p>

<p>"Do not -" <i>hppph</i> "- call me by that peasant name, lowling," she said, finally. "Refer to me as <i>Darth Cassandra</i>-" <i>hpppph</i> "- for I have become one with the dark side of the force."</p>

<p>Coil paused.</p>

<p>"Ah, precognition, you mean. As a force for darkness. You've been reading ahead."</p>

<p>She shook her head, but said nothing. <i>hpppph</i></p>

<p>Coil took a moment to look around the room. It had been barren only days ago, before he'd instructed Pitter to assist his new charge in decoration. Now, the walls were painted a deep, dark blue, the floor was covered with a strange array of implements (why a frying pan?), and Alcott herself sat on a steel throne, still barely on eye level with him.</p>

<p>A good start, really. <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i> had two whole chapters on training up a protege, and Coil seemed to recall <i>evil throne room</i> being one of the later stages. He would know, too: he'd spent hours studying and reviewing those chapters when he initially came up with this plan.</p>

<p>Not that he'd needed to do so, of course. Coil excelled in everything, including training up successors. He had merely been cautious!</p>

<p><i>hppph</i> "Your attention... wanes."</p>

<p>Coil snapped back into reality. His new protege was slouching forward in her throne, tapping her foot.</p>

<p>"What do you -" <i>hpppph</i> "want, lowling? I have little time for peasants such as you."</p>

<p><i>That was quite rude,</i> Coil thought. He wondered if he still had that workplace sensitivity instructor on retainer in this continuity. </p>

<p>"Well, I just thought a reminder was necessary, that I'll be tutoring you on concocting evil plots at two o'clock this afternoon. I hope you haven't forgotten."</p>

<p><i>hpph</i></p>

<p>Coil locked the door behind him when he left.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>"Sir, I have an urgent update for you."</p>

<p>Coil leaned back in his desk. He already had his notes out, phone at the ready - this was, after all, his <i>urgent updates</i> reality. "Go on."</p>

<p>"After the bank incident the other week, your Undersiders apparently chose to hide the cash in a warehouse in disputed territory."</p>

<p>"Certainly sounds like something Tattletale would do," Coil said. When he'd had her apartment searched, he'd found notes she'd made on how to kill him sitting on her desk. He'd made sure to point out some of the (many) flaws. <i>Shoot him while monologuing</i>? That was a crime that bordered on the absurd!</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir. But it appears that you-know-which-gang may have acquired that money."</p>

<p>"Colour me shocked," Coil said, decidedly not shocked. "How might <i>that gang</i> have managed such a feat?"</p>

<p>"I imagine they cut the lock, sir."</p>

<p>"What a terribly difficult thing for a large, well-connected gang to do," said Coil.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir. But I am afraid that was not the bad news."</p>

<p>"Did Tattletale accidentally get herself killed by directly confronting a seven-foot-tall pyrokinetic brute with anger management difficulties?" </p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it is much worse, sir. The Undersiders are currently in combat with that very gang's bomb tinker."</p>

<p>Coil frowned. This wasn't ideal, but he doubted the exact same scenario was happening in every one of his realities - he could always give up the Undersiders in this one if necessary. Of course, that was as long as the Hebert girl - her cape name was <i>Ant</i> for some unfathomable reason - didn't die. "As long as the power booster survives, I believe all outcomes should be acceptable," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, that's exactly the problem, sir. She's still with the Undersiders - physically present with them, I mean, not in spirit - fighting that gang."</p>

<p>"What? Why?" Her ability that improved other parahuman powers lasted for several hours; she was a backline cape, where 'back' actually referred to 'back at home, not fighting dangerous enemies'.</p>

<p>"Quite frankly, sir, I haven't the foggiest."</p>

<p>"Well, get her out of there. Send two teams immediately, and focus on extraction. If you can help the others, do so, but focus on getting Ant out." Perhaps he'd have a second protege by the end of the day. "And do tell them to avoid getting blown up."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. I'll pass that on."</p>

<p>After hanging up the phone, Coil leaned back in his chair, massaging his right hand. In one of the worlds he was in, at least. He was starting to lose track.</p>

<p>Although Coil was a rather practical, rational-minded being, he had to admit that he did find himself prone - in exceedingly rare situations - to a tad bit of stress. His heart wasn't racing, of course (in fact, he'd been told several times he didn't even have one); no butterflies were present in his stomach (the filtration system took care of those); his thinking was hardly impaired (he'd be a genius with even half his current brainpower, so it didn't really matter) - and yet, some small part of himself was <i>worried</i>. Worried that the operation would go wrong. Worried that Bakuda would get her hands on his new favourite underling. Worried that - worried that he'd lose his newfound freedom.</p>

<p>Freedom?</p>

<p>Wasn't it the power that he wanted? With this, even without activating his power, he would be able to solidify his grasp on the city. He'd have the control he wanted -</p>

<p><i>No.</i> A moment later, Coil had left his office behind, moving forward in four realities to take a hallway off to the left.</p>

<p>Cassandra's lair was located deeper into the base than Coil's office, but the two were not that far away; with his long footsteps, it wasn't long before Coil arrived at the doorway. Cassandra didn't seem to stay at the base past mid-afternoon, despite his excellent dinner plans, so he made sure to get her lessons in before then. It was surprisingly relaxing, to pass on his vast knowledge to a young pupil. Investing in the future, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>hppph</i> "What is it you want, lowling?"</p>

<p>"It's time for your studies, child. Please refer to chapter four of your textbook; I believe we left off on some of the exercises; I expect you've come up with answers?"</p>

<p><i>hppph</i></p>

<p>"Child?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen point five percent chance you let me off the hook if I tell you... twenty-eight percent chance of mission failure!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight percent chance of mission failure?" Coil exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was the freedom he wanted - or the power, it didn't matter, he <i>had</i> to do something! Cassandra watched as he pulled out a phone, dialing out to his most trusted operative.</p>

<p>"CS," Coil said, "What's going on? Give me the big picture."</p>

<p>"The Undersiders are barely surviving at this point. We've started providing cover fire under your instructions, but at this distance, it's unlikely we'll achieve anything."</p>

<p>A bead of sweat rolled down the side of Coil's face. Well, Thomas' face, actually. Coil was only a mask that hid his complex inner self.</p>

<p>"What about the team that went to extract, ah, Ant?"</p>

<p>"They were doing quite well, until half of them were literally turned into jelly, and the other half had it happen figuratively."</p>

<p>Coil's hand mysteriously banged against the wall.</p>

<p>"Give me the play by play, CS."</p>

<p>"Hm. Bakuda is screaming something about how intelligent she is; Tattletale keeps turning back to respond. Grue is doing something with his darkness that's trying to smother them, I think. Ah, I see, they have a shot now. Hellhound's ATVs have just shown up."</p>

<p>"Her <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"ATVs. You're surely familiar with that little power interaction, no?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, definitely," Coil said, walking back towards his office. "I have it on good authority that they're not out of the woods yet. What threats are you expecting?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. We're not concerned about Oni Lee, </p>

<p>There was, really, nothing that could make Coil risk losing access to this continuity. If he had it his way, he'd never use his power again.</p>

<p>Coil glanced around. That seemed like the sort of thought that would tempt fate, if only a little. </p>

<p>But nothing happened. Nobody came barging in to his office; no urgent alerts popped up on his computer screen. His phone stayed mercifully silent, as it had been ever since he dropped it in a glass of orange juice.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Finally, Coil relaxed, leaning back. This was the kind of life that he deserved.</p>

<p>Of course, that was when his base blew up.</p>

<p>Thomas stared at his phone. </p>

<p>He'd answered after two rings, and that one sentence had been the only thing the speaker had said before hanging up. A prank call? Perhaps a wrong number?</p>

<p>He couldn't help but ask, regardless: Who, or what, was a <i>Taylor Hebert</i>? A pop show host? A clothing brand? Some new children's toy?</p>

<p>Thomas finally gave in, checking the caller information.</p>

<p><i>Britters [Minion]</i></p>

<p>It was just enough to resurface a memory of his request: <i>"I only need a name, Britters."</i></p>

<p>His henchman had actually come through. Thomas had the name he was looking for, and with it, free rein to abandon this godforsaken temporal continuity entirely. </p>

<p>He considered his options, stepping back from the edge of the roof. The early afternoon sun was starting to become uncomfortable; thinking, he reclaimed his suit jacket and made his way back inside.</p>

<p>Did he call up Piggot to gloat? Push Assault off a building of above average height? He was still marvelling at how he'd been able to make it this long, with no chance for mental release since - he checked his watch - well, much more than twenty-four hours ago. Perhaps he <i>had</i> been getting a bit dependant on that. Oh well.</p>

<p>Piggot's office was down two flights of stairs and across a large room of cubicles. He walked past the plebeian office workers without a second thought, only stopping once he had entered the doorway of the director's questionably decorated office.</p>

<p>"Calvert. What do you need?"</p>

<p>Thomas stared into her eyes, opened his mouth - and then stopped.</p>

<p>What was he doing? He could see the weary look in her eyes, the way her entire expression seemed to drag. That same exhaustion he'd had a taste of, trying to manage even four incompetent superheroes.</p>

<p>He - no. This couldn't be. He was <i>empathizing</i> with her? That wasn't something he'd done since...</p>

<p>Thomas cut off that train of thought. Piggot was staring at him, seemingly on the verge of asking another question. He didn't want to hear it.</p>

<p>Frowning, Thomas used his power, praying to the disturbingly inconsistent gods of fate that he'd end up somewhere far away from that office.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>For years, Coil had used his unrestricted access to two worlds in a delicate way. A reality could be a way to find some emotional release, gain information invisibly, or make high-reward plays with absolutely no risk. All this time, his power had necessitated a delicate balance. </p>

<p>But what could he do with <i>sixteen</i>?</p>

<p>In one universe, he drank coffee with Lung, discussing the most recent edition of <i>Supervillain Seasonals</i> (<i>Illegal Teens: How to recruit youth for your gang</i>). Lung argued that the more impressionable citizens were perfect targets for gang membership; Coil tried in vain to convince him that well-paid mercenaries were far better at following instructions.</p>

<p>In another, he took in the sight that was his desk. One, two, four - twenty-three empty beer cans. An impressive run. He got up to use the washroom, drink still in hand.</p>

<p>Five more worlds were taken up with similar tasks; in some others, he sent his underlings out on moderately risky adventures.</p>

<p>After splitting reality, he'd ended up in this continuity, with all sixteen realities created and ready to use. He hadn't done much since, other than revel in being present in sixteen parallel universes; over the past two days, he'd already started to get used to it. If he'd been apathetic to things before, well.</p>

<p>In another universe, he laughed at footage of the PRT building going up in flames. "This is great, Kerby! Do you think you can do the rig next week?"</p>

<p>"Sir, with all due respect, I think that-"</p>

<p>"That's great! Man, I'd kill to see Piggot's face right now. Literally."</p>

<p>"That would be easier if you hadn't ordered us to make her 'sleep with the fishes', sir."</p>

<p>"I'm a long term planner, Kerby. Don't undermine me here."</p>

<p>That was when, in his most important reality, the phone finally rang.</p>

<p>"Butters."</p>

<p>"It's Britters, sir."</p>

<p>"Britters, then. What do you have to report?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've investigated the girl you mentioned - Taylor Hebert. Progress was rather slow, until I discovered a rather crucial piece of information."</p>

<p>Coil leaned back in his chair. "And what was that, Britters?"</p>

<p>"You recruited her a month ago, sir."</p>

<p>Coil made a note in reality 8, where his wrist was becoming increasingly sore.</p>

<p>He'd successfully recruited the parahuman he'd been searching for, in this continuity? How competent of him.</p>

<p>"It appears that she nearly died to Lung before the Undersiders saved her. Her power allows her to upgrade capes through a strange ritual. Quite frankly, I'm not sure how or why she ended up fighting Lung in the first place. It seems like a rather unwise thing to do. But, I'm sure additional investigation would uncover more in that area."</p>

<p>Coil played with a USB on his desk. "I don't think that will be a problem. You've done marvellously here, Britters. Marvellously."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Making a note with his left hand in one reality - which read 'give Britters a raise', or it would have, if it wasn't completely illegible - Coil ended the call in the current one.</p>

<p>He hadn't been entirely idle over the past days. No, with the power of sixteen Coil-sized brains (which, to clarify, was well above average) he'd been able to come to a fair few conclusions.</p>

<p>First, for some reason the activation of his power - specifically, when he <i>split</i> realities, not when he merged them - was the catalyst for the odd changes in continuity he'd been experiencing. Coil wasn't sure how this was possible; the idea of a power being able to rewrite literally <i>everything</i> that had happened over the span of more than a month was rather mind-boggling. </p>

<p>Not that Coil's mind was particularly boggled. In fact, having sixteen times his normal cognitive capacity was rather effective in staying un-boggled. He did, however, presume that the average plebian's mind would be boggled by such a thing. Heavily boggled.</p>

<p>In the eighth parallel universe, he turned back one page in his notepad.</p>

<p>It was blank.</p>

<p>Hm, he must have forgotten to write the rest of the information down. Regardless, he could remember well enough. <i>The earliest difference between each continuity,</i> he wrote, <i>seems to be the trigger event of one Taylor Hebert</i>.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't entirely accurate. The trigger event - some boring, teenager-drama-laden situation he'd fallen asleep hearing about - always stayed the same, like a rock in the flow of time. From that point, however, history rewrote itself each time he used his power: every split, that Hebert girl would end up triggering with a different power. And a bizarre one, too, more often than not.</p>

<p>The notes he'd found in this continuity from - well, the previous <i>him</i> - just confirmed that. One folder was dedicated to long-form writeups on each of the previous alternate powers the <i>previous him</i> had encountered; it went along with an entire <i>binder</i> filled with ranting and raving about on in particular, where she'd directed invertebrates or something. Not something Coil could imagine himself ever writing, really.</p>

<p>Which didn't do much to settle the unease at wondering if he himself, just like the Coil whose notes he'd been reading through, would eventually be replaced by yet <i>another</i> version of himself. Or was that not how this sort of thing worked?</p>

<p>Well, there was no way for him to know, not unless he used his power enough times to eventually find a universe where he'd somehow acquired that information. This Coil, at least, was <i>done</i> trying to understand the full mechanics of what was going on. The fundamentals were more than enough.</p>

<p>Specifically, the fundamental truth that he was <i>never, ever</i> using his power again. </p>

<p>Sixteen realities! Sixteen beautifully crafted, perfectly separate, universes. Each connected by one great, universe-spanning being (i.e., Coil). Each providing a container for his immense genius, a vector for his majestic schemes.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he couldn't refresh them? No.</p>

<p>Did it matter that he'd already essentially wasted three on incredibly petty revenge? No!</p>

<p>Did anything really matter, in this cruel, bitter world?</p>

<p>Well, that remained to be seen. Coil was certainly starting to feel a bit more fatalistic, although that might have been the entire <i>experiencing sixteen universes simultaneously</i> thing.</p>

<p>In the current universe, he went to go check on another project his past self (that no longer was) had begun. In all sixteen worlds, he had access to one Dinah Alcott - a precognitive with powers to rival his. If not mental acuity.</p>

<p>"Alcott. How are you adjusting?"</p>

<p>The girl adjusted her mask, deep breathing sounds coming through what seemed to be an air filter at the bottom. Coil wasn't quite sure why; he had a very complex filtration setup already running for the underground base. It had been expensive, too.</p>

<p>"Do not -" <i>hppph</i> "- call me by that peasant name, lowling," she said, finally. "Refer to me as <i>Darth Cassandra</i>-" <i>hpppph</i> "- for I have become one with the dark side of the force."</p>

<p>Coil paused.</p>

<p>"Ah, precognition, you mean. As a force for darkness."</p>

<p>She shook her head, but said nothing. </p>

<p><i>hpppph</i></p>

<p>Coil took a moment to look around the room. It had been barren only days ago, before he'd instructed Pitter to assist his new charge in decoration. Now, the walls were painted a deep, dark blue, the floor was covered with a strange array of implements (why a frying pan?), and Alcott herself sat on a steel throne, still barely on eye level with him.</p>

<p>A good start, really. <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i> had two whole chapters on training up a protege, and he seemed to recall <i>evil throne room</i> being one of the later stages. He would know; he'd spent hours studying and reviewing those chapters when he initially came up with this plan.</p>

<p>Not that he'd needed to do so, of course. Coil excelled in everything, including training up successors. He had merely been cautious!</p>

<p><i>hppph</i> "Your attention... wanes."</p>

<p>Coil snapped back into reality. His new protege was slouching forward in her throne, tapping her foot.</p>

<p>"What do you -" <i>hpppph</i> "want, lowling? I have little time for peasants such as you."</p>

<p><i>That was quite rude,</i> Coil thought. He wondered if he still had that workplace sensitivity trainer on retainer in this continuity. </p>

<p>"Well, I just thought a reminder was necessary, that I'll be mentoring you on concocting evil plots at two o'clock this afternoon. I hope you haven't forgotten."</p>

<p><i>hpph</i></p>

<p>Coil locked the door behind him when he left.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>There was, really, nothing that could make Coil risk losing access to this continuity. If he had it his way, he'd never use his power again.</p>

<p>Coil glanced around. That seemed like the sort of thought that would tempt fate, if only a little. </p>

<p>But nothing happened. Nobody came barging in to his office; no urgent alerts popped up on his computer screen. His phone stayed mercifully silent, as it had been ever since he dropped it in a glass of orange juice.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Finally, Coil relaxed, leaning back. This was the kind of life that he deserved.</p>

<p>Of course, that was when his base blew up.</p>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"The Empire is currently retaliating against the Undersiders for revealing their identities. Purity is in the midst of-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's ridiculous. Why would the Undersiders unmask the Empire?"</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, they didn't, you did. The Empire simply-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"I did <i>what?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>I</i> don't understand, Storb. What could have <i>possibly</i> possessed me to do something like that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"Sir..."</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil paced back towards his office door. He thought he had become accustomed to it by now - researching the strange histories that seemed to always exist in new continuities, discovering what his past self had done. Sometimes mistakes, sometimes strange behaviour - sometimes things that simply could not have followed from his basic thought processes.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">This, however, was downright unfair. Unmasking a single cape was a crime that bordered on the absurd; to do so for an entire rival gang threatened everything that Coil stood for. Everything that he had <i>thought</i> he stood for, that is: the rights of free men (and women, of course) to unabashedly commit crimes without ever putting their lifestyle in jeopardy.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil would not stand for this.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">He sat down.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, it's too late to go back now. What was that you were saying about Purity?"</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"She's demolishing the Docks in a search for the Undersiders, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil consulted his past-self's documentation. In this continuity, Taylor Hebert had apparently triggered with the ability to -- <i>summon and control flying manatees</i>? She'd promptly joined the Undersiders, somehow being given the name <i>Mantabee</i>, which made a peculiar kind of non-sense. She'd - well, she'd saved the Undersiders from Lung (Manatee allergy, who would have guessed?), robbed a bank with the gang, been injured fighting Bakuda, waged war on Bakuda's gang... and, of course, attacked a PRT fundraiser.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">Considering that all seemed to happen in <i>every single continuity</i>, this told Coil approximately nothing about her or her capabilities. But there was one obvious solution:</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"Why don't the Undersiders just ride manatees out of the Docks?"</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-14.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

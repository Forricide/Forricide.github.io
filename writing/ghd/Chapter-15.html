<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">"Please repeat that."</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"The Empire is currently retaliating against the Undersiders for revealing their identities. Purity is in the midst of-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's ridiculous. Why would the Undersiders unmask the Empire?"</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, they didn't, you did. The Empire simply-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"I did <i>what?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, with all due respect, I'm not sure I understand. Your orders were to-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>I</i> don't understand, Storb. What could have <i>possibly</i> possessed me to do something like that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Sir...</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil paced back towards his office door. He thought he had become accustomed to it by now - researching the strange histories that seemed to always exist in new continuities, discovering what his past self had done. Sometimes strange behaviour, sometimes mistakes - sometimes actions that simply could not have followed from his basic thought processes.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">This, however, was downright unfair. Unmasking a single cape was a crime that bordered on the absurd; to do so for an entire rival gang threatened everything that Coil stood for. Everything that he had <i>thought</i> he stood for, that is: the rights of free, patriotic Americans to unabashedly commit crimes without ever putting their everyday lifestyle in jeopardy.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil would not stand for this.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">He sat down.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, it's too late to go back now, I suppose."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>That's likely correct, sir.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Too bad for the Empire. I suppose they'll just have to cede their territory to me - as was inevitable. What was that you were saying about Purity?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"She's demolishing the Docks in a search for the Undersiders, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, that's a shame."</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil consulted his past-self's documentation. In this continuity, Taylor Hebert had apparently triggered with the ability to -- <i>summon and control flying manatees</i>? She'd promptly joined the Undersiders, somehow being given the name <i>Mantabee</i>, which made a peculiar kind of non-sense. She'd - well, she'd saved the Undersiders from Lung (Manatee allergy, who would have guessed?), robbed a bank with the gang, been injured fighting Bakuda, waged war on Bakuda's gang... and, of course, attacked a PRT fundraiser.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Considering that all seemed to happen in <i>every single continuity</i>, this told Coil approximately nothing about her or her capabilities. But there was one obvious solution:</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"Why don't the Undersiders just ride her manatees out of the Docks?"</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Well, Mantabee believes that they have a responsibility to prevent Purity from destroying the area.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"Isn't their presence in the area the <i>entire reason</i> Purity is doing this?"</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Er... true. But Purity might find them if they were to attempt an escape.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">"Isn't she more likely to find them if they stay in the exact place she's searching?"</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Hm... Well, the manatees would get very tired, sir.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"Then <i>what's the use of the manatees</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>She's actually been using them to make manatee skin armour. Form-fitting and bulletproof - did you know that black manatees have skin with a higher tensile strength than steel?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's horrific - she <i>flays</i> them?!"</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>With respect, sir, weren't we discussing the Purity problem?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">"Frankly, I'm more interested in the flayed manatees. How do they even follow her commands? Are they <i>sentient?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>That's a great question, sir. I'm sure Mantabee would love to discuss that with you, later, after escaping with her life.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed and rubbed his nose. "All right. I'll look into a solution."</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">In reality, he was already pursuing a solution. Or, rather, in <i>another</i> reality. Dinah, his unpaid intern, was supposed to be working on puzzling out if his tax return was correct; Coil knocked on the door.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">"Enter," came the response after a few seconds, buzzing out of a speaker to the side.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"This doesn't look like accounting," Coil said, closing the door behind him.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">Dinah didn't look away from her hand. "Poker is like accounting," she said, placing down a card. "This is a part of the path towards enlightenment."</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">Sundancer, apparently losing badly, nodded. "Accounting is math, which is the basis of poker, you know?"</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Beside her, Ballistic looked like his soul had seeped out into his missing chips.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fine," Coil said, "I need your help. The Undersiders are under attack by Purity, and-"</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'll do it," Ballistic said. "Sure. I can take her out."</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">"Actually, I was asking Dinah-"</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">"Sounds like I'm out of this game - you enjoy, Mars."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Sundancer looked down at the table. "I'm out, actually. I can join in."</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ninety-five percent chance Tattletale figures out how to calm Purity down," Dinah said, shuffling the deck. "Let's play another round."</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">Ballistic frowned. "There's still a five percent chance that-"</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"She's quit the Undersiders, sir. Moral compunctions with your mistreatment of Miss Alcott, reportedly."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"She hardly has room to talk," Coil said. "You know, considering all the flayed manatees."</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I did hear that she anesthetizes them, beforehand. For what it's worth."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">"I watched footage of it, </p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">But this did bring up a good reminder. Coil glanced behind him, where Dinah was practicing with a sniper rifle. "Dinah."</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">She lined up another shot.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">"You need to wear hearing protection."</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I don't think she'll be returning to the Undersiders any time soon, sir. Seems like a clean break. Teenagers, you know?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">"Indeed, Britters."</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Well</i>, Coil thought, <i>that's that.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">This continuity had enjoyed a solid probationary period, but it didn't seem like the best possible path he could take. Surely, if he searched enough alternate worlds, he would eventually find one where he had succeeded in his short-term goals. Perhaps one where he was PRT director, or even one where he had a competent parahuman team.</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">Dinah had told him, in some long-lost continuity, that she had no way of knowing how dangerous it would be to use his power. He was the only person he knew of - likely the only person in the world - that had any information on it, and even he only had a limited sample size. In how many continuities was he dead? It was impossible to guess - surely a small portion, considering he'd been successful thus far.</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">But could it really be worth it, to take that risk, to find a better reality?</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>No</i>, he thought. The success he'd seen wasn't off the back of something silly like luck.</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">It was his brain! His absurdly genius intellect, with which he'd built this empire. And his power, but that was a side note. Hardly important.</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">He would claim this continuity as his own, and find his own success. There was no event that could possibly prevent that!</p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">That was when the Endbringer sirens went off.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-14.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-16.html">Next</a></b></p>

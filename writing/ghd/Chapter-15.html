<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">"Please repeat that."</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"The Empire is currently retaliating against the Undersiders for revealing their identities. Purity is in the midst of-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's ridiculous. Why would the Undersiders unmask the Empire?"</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, they didn't, you did. The Empire simply-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"I did <i>what?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, with all due respect, I'm not sure I understand. Your orders were to-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>I</i> don't understand, Storb. What could have <i>possibly</i> possessed me to do something like that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Sir...</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil paced back towards his office door. He thought he had become accustomed to it by now - researching the strange histories that seemed to always exist in new continuities, discovering what his past self had done. Sometimes strange behaviour, sometimes mistakes - sometimes actions that simply could not have followed from his basic thought processes.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">This, however, was downright unfair. Unmasking a single cape was a crime that bordered on the absurd; to do so for an entire rival gang threatened everything that Coil stood for. Everything that he had <i>thought</i> he stood for, that is: the rights of free, patriotic Americans to unabashedly commit crimes without ever putting their everyday lifestyle in jeopardy.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil would not stand for this.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">He sat down.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, it's too late to go back now, I suppose."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>That's likely correct, sir.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Too bad for the Empire. I suppose they'll just have to cede their territory to me - as was inevitable. What was that you were saying about Purity?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"She's demolishing the Docks in a search for the Undersiders, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, that's a shame."</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil consulted his past-self's documentation. In this continuity, Taylor Hebert had apparently triggered with the ability to -- <i>summon and control flying manatees</i>? She'd promptly joined the Undersiders, somehow being given the name <i>Mantabee</i>, which made a peculiar kind of non-sense. She'd - well, she'd saved the Undersiders from Lung (Manatee allergy, who would have guessed?), robbed a bank with the gang, been injured fighting Bakuda, waged war on Bakuda's gang... and, of course, attacked a PRT fundraiser.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Considering that all seemed to happen in <i>every single continuity</i>, this told Coil approximately nothing about her or her capabilities. But there was one obvious solution:</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"Why don't the Undersiders just ride her manatees out of the Docks?"</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Well, Mantabee believes that they have a responsibility to prevent Purity from destroying the area.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"Isn't their presence in the area the <i>entire reason</i> Purity is doing this?"</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Er... true. But Purity might find them if they were to attempt an escape.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">"Isn't she more likely to find them if they stay in the exact place she's searching?"</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Hm... Well, the manatees would get very tired, sir.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">"Then <i>what's the use of the manatees</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>She's actually been using them to make manatee skin armour. Form-fitting and bulletproof - did you know that black manatees have skin with a higher tensile strength than steel?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's horrific - she <i>flays</i> them?!"</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>With respect, sir, weren't we discussing the Purity problem?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">"Frankly, I'm more interested in the flayed manatees. How do they even follow her commands? Are they <i>sentient?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>That's a great question, sir. I'm sure Mantabee would love to discuss that with you, later, after escaping with her life.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed and rubbed his nose. "All right. I'll look into a solution."</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">In reality, he was already pursuing a solution. Or, rather, in <i>another</i> reality. Dinah, his unpaid intern, was supposed to be working on puzzling out if his tax return was correct; Coil knocked on the door.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">"Enter," came the response after a few seconds, buzzing out of a speaker to the side.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"This doesn't look like accounting," Coil said, closing the door behind him.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">Dinah didn't look away from her hand. "Poker is like accounting," she said, placing down a card. "This is a part of the path towards enlightenment."</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">Sundancer, apparently losing badly, nodded. "Accounting is math, which is the basis of poker, you know?"</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Beside her, Ballistic looked like his soul had seeped out into his missing chips.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fine," Coil said, "I need your help. The Undersiders are under attack by Purity, and-"</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'll do it," Ballistic said. "Sure. I can take her out."</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">"Actually, I was asking Dinah-"</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">"Sounds like I'm out of this game - you enjoy, Mars."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Sundancer looked down at the table. "I'm out, actually. I can join in."</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ninety-five percent chance Tattletale figures out how to calm Purity down," Dinah said, shuffling the deck. "Only an eight percent chance of a member of the Undersiders dying. Let's play another round."</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">Ballistic frowned. "There's still a five percent chance that-"</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">"Let's play another round. Eighty-five percent chance I let you win," Dinah said.</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil closed the door behind him.</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">Another headache, almost dealt with. Coil wasn't exactly great with mathematics, but he supposed with an eight percent chance of an Undersider dying - that was, what, one in thirty? Basically impossible, really.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">So he did the sane thing, and kicked back in a chair to drink for a few hours.</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil was in a much better state of mind.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">If, every time he used his power, the entire world changed underneath him - invalidating his work, undoing his tireless efforts of improving the city or spreading knowledge to the next generation - why bother? There was, he realized, literally no point in helping anyone except himself.</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">And, to take that a step further, the only thing that he could do that would actually <i>persist</i> between continuities - was self-improvement.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">Unfortunately, Coil was already perfect. So he'd settled for a second best choice, which was to create art, with the knowledge that nobody else would have ever appreciated it properly anyways.</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">For this reason (and many others), he was seated in front of his laptop, typing away. The previous Coil from this continuity had never even started into Coil's incredible Oni Lee/Armsmaster fic, so Coil was stuck recreating it from scratch, his alcohol-fuelled imaginings bringing it to an entirely new level. Not a better level, but that was something to fix later on.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">Around when he completed the second chapter, his phone rang. Coil contemplated ignoring it, but his flow state was already ruined. The tragedy of a century - who knew what could have happened, if he'd just been able to focus and write the entirety of the story in one sitting? The world would never find out.</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">He had needed to refill the mini fridge, anyways.</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"Coil speaking."</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I have a status update, sir,"</i> came Britters' voice over the phone.</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, just what I was waiting for. Good work, Britters. Go ahead." Coil alt-tabbed his laptop from Notepad into a web browser, and quickly opened the news.</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, I have good news, and I have bad news, sir. Which would you like to hear first?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil shrugged. "The good news, I suppose." There wasn't anything too terrible in the most recent articles he could see: "Abandoned Area Of Docks Destroyed"; "Shockingly Large Number of People Living in Docks"; "Québécois Teen Starts GoFundMe to Replace Video Game Collection". All in all, it seemed like a non-event.</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, none of the Undersiders died,"</i> said Britters.</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil waited.</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Anyways, that's it for the good news, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, that's still quite good, I suppose. I still have the Undersiders, then."</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, no, sir. That's the bad news. They all quit."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">"What! How could they?"</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Very easily, sir. Apparently you never had any of them sign contracts."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's not what I meant, and that's perfectly normal for minion employment. I mean - well, why did Tattletale leave?"</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I'm not quite sure, sir. Word from intelligence is that she seems to have come into quite a large sum of money."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fascinating. Well, good for her, I suppose. But - Regent, Grue? They were relying on me."</p></a>

<a name="pg73"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Intelligence didn't really turn up anything for them, sir. But - they're Gen Z, aren't they? They're not exactly the best at holding down jobs. Probably want to laze about and play video games."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg74"><p class="content-paragraph">"True, Britters. It's not like Grue's power was ever that impressive - darkness generation? That happens automatically every night anyways."</p></a>

<a name="pg75"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Indeed, sir."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg76"><p class="content-paragraph">"What about Mantabee? She was showing some promise. Perhaps she can be hired on separately?"</p></a>

<a name="pg77"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"She's very gone, sir. Moral compunctions with your mistreatment of Miss Alcott, reportedly."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg78"><p class="content-paragraph">"Excuse me? She hardly has room to talk," Coil said. "You know, considering all the flayed manatees."</p></a>

<a name="pg79"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I did hear that she anaesthetizes them, beforehand. For what it's worth."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg80"><p class="content-paragraph">"I watched footage of it, Britters. That's not worth very much."</p></a>

<a name="pg81"><p class="content-paragraph">But this did bring up a good reminder. Coil took out a pen and jotted down a note: <i>ensure dinah wears hearing protection when practicing rifle marksmanship</i></p></a>

<a name="pg82"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Regardless, I don't think she'll be returning to the Undersiders any time soon, sir. Seems like a clean break. Teenagers, you know?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg83"><p class="content-paragraph">"Indeed, Britters," Coil said, and hung up.</p></a>

<a name="pg84"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Well</i>, Coil thought, <i>that's that.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg85"><p class="content-paragraph">This continuity had enjoyed a solid probationary period. It was true that it didn't seem like the best possible path he could take. Surely, if he searched enough alternate worlds, he would eventually find one where he had succeeded in his short-term goals. Perhaps one where he was PRT director, or even one where he had a competent parahuman team.</p></a>

<a name="pg86"><p class="content-paragraph">But Dinah had told him, in some long-lost continuity, that she had no way of knowing how dangerous it would be to use his power. He was the only person he knew of - likely the only person in the world - that had any information on it, and even he only had a limited sample size. In how many continuities was he dead? It was impossible to guess - surely a small portion, considering he'd been successful thus far.</p></a>

<a name="pg87"><p class="content-paragraph">Was it really worth it, to take that risk, to find a better reality?</p></a>

<a name="pg88"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>No</i>, he thought. The success he'd seen wasn't off the back of something silly like luck.</p></a>

<a name="pg89"><p class="content-paragraph">It was his brain! His absurdly genius intellect, with which he'd built this empire. And his power, but that was a side note. Hardly important.</p></a>

<a name="pg90"><p class="content-paragraph">He would claim this continuity as his own, and find his own success. There was no event that could possibly prevent that!</p></a>

<a name="pg91"><p class="content-paragraph">That was when the Endbringer sirens went off.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-14.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-16.html">Next</a></b></p>

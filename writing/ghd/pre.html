<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Please note: Less discerning readers may not be able to tell that Coil's character in this story is not, in fact, entirely faithful to the source material, so I would like to get it out of the way that this story is indeed a "COIL" story. (For those of you not - how to put it - 'in the know', COIL is a common acronym for 'Coil Only In Likeness', or if you prefer, 'COIL Only In Likeness', which serves better as an explanation of recursion but worse as anything else)</p></a></body>

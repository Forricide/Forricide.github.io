<p>Please note: Less discerning readers may not be able to tell that Coil's character here is not, in fact, entirely faithful to the source material, so I would like to get it out of the way that this story is indeed a "COIL" story. (That is, 'Coil Only In Likeness', or if you prefer, 'COIL Only In Likeness', which serves better as an explanation of recursion but worse as anything else)</p>

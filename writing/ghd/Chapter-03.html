<p>"Calvert. Calvert. Look at me." His vision swam, eyes adjusting to the sudden fluorescent lighting. "Thomas? Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Wh-oh, ah, Director Piggot. I, uh, apologize for my lack of attentiveness."</p>

<p>The director of the local PRT gave him a strange look. "Are you okay, Thomas? You've been acting weird all day."</p>

<p>All day. Right. What had happened? He'd split timelines, ostensibly to investigate the possibility of his power causing small differences between uses. At the same moment, he'd somehow moved locations - several miles, in fact - and ended up, within both timelines, in this office. <i>Director Emily Piggot</i>'s office, wearing a suit and tie and... was that a badge on his lapel? Why yes, yes it was. </p>

<p>All in all, this was not what he would call a <i>small</i> difference.</p>

<p>He felt at the badge idly with his left hand. It wasn't possible to tell exactly what it was without looking at it, but it seemed suspiciously similar to the one that Piggot herself was wearing, just with slightly fewer points.</p>

<p>"I'm doing fine, thank you. Great, in fact. I'm just..." Thomas thought fast. Had he been promoted, somehow? Given an important position in the PRT? The wrong turn of phrase could give away too much, leading to his incarceration, death, or - the worst of them all - a prolonged stay in Master-Stranger Contamination Facilities.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Thomas had two tries at this, or so he hoped.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he shrugged. "It's a bit difficult to adapt. I've been doing other things for so long."</p>

<p>Piggot scoffed. At him! <i>How dare she?</i> "I'm sure that this will be well within your capabilities, Calvert. Now, I do need your input on this plan. I don't have the same view of this situation as you do. Do you think this will work?"</p>

<p>That seemed good enough to him, so he copied the response in the other timeline, to similar results (albeit with a moderately louder scoff). </p>

<p>"I'm not sure I've completely understood what you're doing," he said, hoping that it would come off as more of a lack of attention than anything else. "Could you summarize the general concept for me?"</p>

<p>"That's the <i>third time</i> you've asked for a summary now, Calvert. You're starting to make me doubt that you're up to this responsibility."</p>

<p>"It's, uh, just the wording that's getting to me," he said, hopeful.</p>

<p>"Fine. I will <i>completely rephrase</i> the summary for you. It's really not that complicated. As you're well aware, a recent parahuman trigger in the Bay has led to a complete destabilizing of the balance between gangs."</p>

<p><i>I didn't know that,</i> Thomas thought morosely.</p>

<p>Emily picked up a pen and circled (again) a location on what appeared to be a low-resolution printout of the Brockton Bay map. "This is the general vicinity of where we believe the parahuman first triggered. Anything more specific than that is <i>obviously</i> impossible to obtain right now, although I'm led to believe that there's a working group of thinkers who are attempting it."</p>

<p>As the director paused, Thomas looked out the window. His vantage point was rather poor, yet he could still see smoke rising from distant buildings. </p>

<p>"Regardless, what we do know is good enough. A parahuman triggered with the power to control the limbs of people meeting some as-of-yet unknown criteria. They can't control everyone, as evidenced by the infighting between Empire Eighty-Eight members yesterday, but their restrictions appear to be completely arbitrary thus far."</p>

<p>She stopped talking. Then her demeanour cracked, bit by bit. "I just-" she snorted- "I just ca-" a laugh, deeper this time- "can't, every time I think about that, the <i>pfft</i> chicken dance, oh," and then Thomas was watching as <i>Emily Piggot</i> broke into full-on laughter, holding her head with both hands.</p>

<p>Thomas waited patiently while she calmed down. He had to admit, he had been prepared for a lot of things, but this? This was truly baffling.</p>

<p>After what felt like an hour, Piggot stopped laughing, a tear still on one cheek. "My apologies. </p>

<p>In one timeline, he went straight home. There was no hot meal waiting for him, but to his surprise there <i>was</i> half a pizza left over in the fridge. More than good enough.</p>

<p>In the other, and with not a small amount of trepidation, he returned to his underground base. Preliminary inspection gave no indication that anything was amiss compared to when he had, for lack of a better term, 'left' it. He still called his three deputies before entering, fully suited up.</p>

<p>Every time Coil split the universe, split fate, he also split his mind. Two brains thinking in what <i>should</i> have been parallel, but thanks to his immense genius, he was more than capable of diverging completely and thinking twice as much as normal. (He cleverly referred to this as <i>doublethink</i>) </p>

<p>Lesser mortals would surely pale at the feats of intellect he was able to pull off: on one of his more inspired days, he'd successfully infiltrated the PRT not once, not twice, but <i>seven</i> times. It was true that each of these times, it had been under the guise of his fully cleared civilian identity, but that hardly diminished the achievement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these peculiar circumstances were such that even his most focused mind working at double the throughput wasn't enough to fully comprehend the current state of events.</p>

<p>"You're telling me that they're <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yessiree. Done and dusted, as me mom used to say, 'fore she bit the ol' bullet." </p>

<p>Before responding, Coil checked the caller information. <i>Cody Briggs</i>. It looked like <i>somebody</i> was receiving a pay cut. It was important to talk in a proper, educated manner when speaking with the greatest and most brilliant parahuman in the entirety of Brockton Bay. He also had the best hair, even if he had woken up to find his mohawk mysteriously gone, and replaced by a ratty fedora bearing his initials.</p>

<p>"Riddle me this, Bridges. If they're dead, then how is it that just yesterday, Tattletale herself briefed me on the results of the Lung encounter?"</p>

<p>"Dunno what to tell ya, boss. You saw the footage yesterday, nuttin' new since then. Dunno how that Tattletale would'a been able to say anything, with the whole sixth-degree-burns 'n all.'"</p>

<p>Coil leaned forward over his desk. "...the footage?"</p>

<p>"Yessir! The one I showed to ya yesterday, caught it with Leet's magic ball doo-dad thingy."</p>

<p>Could Bridges know that Coil used the Snitch to watch- <i>no, that would be ridiculous.</i> "Which footage, Bridges?"</p>

<p>"Ya don't remember, boss?" </p>

<p>Ah, there it was. <i>Disrespect</i>. Well, this was what Coil curated his 'Disposable Dimwits' list of employees for. Oh yes, this name was getting <i>circled</i>. "Bridges, boy, do you know how much data my usel- er, minions send me to review every day?"</p>

<p>"Uh, a big-ol' load?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bridges. A very large amount. And most of it is completely uninformative drivel, so devoid of any value whatsoever that it is literally worth less than the bytes of space it occupies. So tell me, Bridges, <i>what footage did'ya send me</i>?" <i>Patience, Calvert.</i></p>

<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. "I sent it t'ya on the good-ol' information highway, bossman. Internet mail with the subject, er," the man on the other end of the line paused, as if searching for something. Coil waited. In another timeline, he cleaned his shotgun. "Ah, it was: 'Shocking footage inside! Must watch! NSFL'. That ring a bell?"</p>

<p>Coil sighed and hung up the phone. Surprisingly, the email was indeed in his inbox, and already marked as read. <i>Probably just an anti-spam measure.</i> </p>

<p>He clicked on the video attachment and pressed <b>play</b>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A figure, lying prone on the roof of a dilapidated building, was watching the street below. They were wearing a leather jacket, a cowboy hat, and a gas mask. <i>A strange combination</i>, Coil mused. The mask was understandable in Brockton Bay - the streets never smelled particularly pleasant, nor did the people - but the rest of their costume was almost taken out of an old Western movie. And, quite frankly, leather jackets had gone out of style years ago. Tight spandex was the future.</p>

<p>Although roof-sitting was, as far as Coil was aware, a common pastime for the plebeian population of Brockton Bay, this particular peasant appeared to have a different reason entirely for their penchant for patient perception. Just in frame, down in the streets below, an unfortunately recognizable Asian gang leader was visible, speaking with several men who were presumably his subordinates.</p>

<p>The camera's microphone wasn't particularly powerful, but as Coil turned up the volume, the conversation became audible. It was Lung, speaking in a fairly calm tone of voice, as if discussing the weather: "...the children, just shoot.  Doesn't matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot-" </p>

<p>Coil muted the speakers. Now <i>that</i> was just unpleasant to listen to. Killing children, even Coil thought that went too far! Besides the minor ethical considerations (mostly irrelevant, honestly), it was just plain wasteful - children could be useful, but generally weren't as corpses. He was going to have to have a talk with Lung, the next time he saw him at the salon.</p>

<p>Still, if what Goot had told him was true, things were only going to get worse from here.</p>

<p>Lung continued gesturing for a few seconds, then turned away as if to leave. </p>

<p>The person lying on the roof stood up slowly, dusting themselves off. Then, before Lung had taken even a single step, they jumped off the roof and down to the road below, the camera sweeping forward to follow their path.</p>

<p>As Coil unmuted the audio, the street came into view. And, to his surprise, so did a gigantic horse that appeared to have just been waiting there in a right turn lane. Coil watched with mixed emotions as the masked person fell directly into sitting position on the horse. <i>Ouch</i>, he thought, <i>that's got to hurt.</i></p>

<p>Lung had, evidently, not noticed the horse or its rider previously. He spun around faster than his subordinates, guns appearing out of nowhere.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>That deep, booming voice sent shivers down Thomas' spine. Not the good ones, either. He'd been fried alive a few times by Lung, and yet he'd never quite gotten used to it.</p>

<p>"Me? Just a new fella lookin' for some action, partner," the rider responded. "Y'all aren't gettin' away with this one!"</p>

<p>Lung shrugged, and gestured at his minions, who started firing almost before the gesture was complete.</p>

<p>For all their flair, the rider didn't appear to be ready for gunfire. Well, at least, their horse wasn't - instead of putting up any kind of fight, it bucked sharply in fright, turned around, and galloped straight away from the gangsters, with its rider barely hanging on.</p>

<p>It looked like Lung considered chasing for a moment, then decided against it. The camera followed him, from a distance, as he made his rendezvous with Oni Lee.</p>

<p>Coil stopped the video before all of the Undersiders died.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p><i>What did I just witness?</i> </p>

<p>None of this made sense. None of this made <i>any sense</i> at all. Coil almost considered calling back that half-wit he'd spoken with, Loda Bridges or whatever his name was. Almost.</p>

<p>Instead, he looked at his desk, and noticed a folder that he hadn't seen before. Unlabelled, it contained several sheets of paper, each covered in notes. A rather familiar style of notes.</p>

<p>An analysis by Tattletale. Even in death, she was useful.</p>

<p><i>people from all over city experiencing linguistic changes, new habits means wide-range power in effect</i></p>

<p><i>no demands made, no public appearance, nothing in news indicates possibly unintentional or unconscious power use</i></p>

<p><i>personality/etc changes are different person to person -> somehow based off person themselves</i></p>

<p><i>-> subject has unconscious power to make other nearby people (-> range?) want to imitate western movies, generally quite poorly</i></p>

<p><i>-> time-wise, change occurs right after incident at Mediocrity High</i></p>

<p><i>-> student is likely culprit, gained cowboy-shaker powers due to love of Westerns + shaker flavour seems to come from isolation/fear</i></p>

<p><i>-> student is same student mentioned previously, triggered from being bullied for enjoying Western movies</i></p>

<p>Well, that would explain the call with Cobra Brinks (or whatever his name was). Thomas groaned, mask and fedora off, rubbing his forehead. This was starting to give him a headache.</p>

<p>He had just the solution.</p>

<p>Splitting into new timelines, he reached out for -</p>

<p>The folder was gone.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't quite right. In both timelines, the folder was still there. But it was closed, had a flower design on the outside, and was sitting about a foot further back than it should have been.</p>

<p>In other words, the folder he'd been using was gone, but a new one had spontaneously taken its place. He wasn't a physicist, but some sort of quantum superposition had clearly just occurred.</p>

<p><i>Huh,</i> Thomas thought, <i>that's never happened to me before.</i></p>

<p>In one timeline, he finally cracked, pulling out a twelve pack from the mini fridge in his desk.</p>

<p>In the other, he tentatively reached out and took hold of the folder. He was ready for anything - for the notes to start talking, or the folder to try and escape, or even for it to contain an apology from Tattletale for being too incompetent. Well, maybe not that last one, but he could dream.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p><i>Well, of course,</i> Thomas thought. <i>It's just a folder, after all.</i></p>

<p>He opened the folder, and a gigantic mechanical clown head popped out, stopping just an inch before colliding with his face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Thomas screamed, in a low and very masculine voice. "What in the..?"</p>

<p>The clown head bounced up and down, lifeless.</p>

<p>Thomas took a shower.</p>

<p>When he got back to his office, he was prepared. He started by examining the clown head; it gave no clues to anything abnormal, other than the fact that it - upon being placed back into the folder - seemed to compress itself into an impossibly flat shape. Otherwise, he failed to find anything particularly interesting or informative about the... giant clown head.</p>

<p>Setting the space-warping device aside, Coil took a look at the notes inside the folder themselves. These notes were much briefer than the last set, written in large, comfortable cursive instead of shaky print.</p>

<p><i>hey moron</i></p>

<p><i>had a nice laugh at the lung fight? well, look who's laughing now</i></p>

<p><i>us and that justice-tinker? yeah, turns out we get along. a lot better than I did with you, believe it or not</i></p>

<p><i>sleep well tonight loser, you're on our list, if you know what I mean</i></p>

<p><i>oh, I forgot. you don't have an actually intelligent thinker to help you out</i></p>

<p><i>let me spell things out, because I know you won't back down: we're coming after you, snake-face.</i></p>

<p>Coil set down the letter.</p>

<p>He would have been angry, but if he was being entirely honest with himself, this was more frustrating than anything else. The events of the previous day had been absurdly discontinuous, even for someone with his powers, and he was slowly beginning to suspect that some abnormality was afoot.</p>

<p>Thankfully, he could (somewhat) remember his high school science classes. In order to understand a strange phenomenon, it was advisable to first form one or multiple hypotheses, then give little Jimmy MacAdder his lunch money for the solutions to the rest of the assignment.</p>

<p>No, wait, that wasn't right. </p>

<p>Hypotheses, then approach them with tests to confirm. <i>Power testing</i>. Coil grinned. Now that sounded like an enjoyable use of time, something he could really sink his teeth into.</p>

<p>He drained the last can of beer in his other timeline, then closed it. No time like the present, as his father used to say.</p>

<p>Coil put on his mask, took a deep breath, and split reality.</p>

<p>"Calvert. Calvert. Look at me." His vision swam, eyes adjusting to the sudden fluorescent lighting. "Thomas? Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Wh-oh, ah, Director Piggot. I, uh, apologize for my lack of attentiveness."</p>

<p>The director of the local PRT gave him a strange look. "Are you okay, Thomas? You've been acting weird all day."</p>

<p>All day. Right. What had happened? He'd split timelines, ostensibly to investigate the possibility of his power causing small differences between uses. At the same moment, he'd somehow moved locations - several miles, in fact - and ended up, within both timelines, in this office. <i>Director Emily Piggot</i>'s office, wearing a suit and tie and... was that a badge on his lapel? Why yes, yes it was. </p>

<p>All in all, this was not what he would call a <i>small</i> difference.</p>

<p>He felt at the badge idly with his left hand. It wasn't possible to tell exactly what it was without looking at it, but it seemed suspiciously similar to the one that Piggot herself was wearing, just with slightly fewer points.</p>

<p>"I'm doing fine, thank you. Great, in fact. I'm just..." Thomas thought fast. Had he been promoted, somehow? Given an important position in the PRT? The wrong turn of phrase could give away too much, leading to his incarceration, death, or - the worst of them all - a prolonged stay in Master-Stranger Contamination Facilities.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Thomas had two tries at this, or so he hoped.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he shrugged. "It's a bit difficult to adapt. I've been doing other things for so long."</p>

<p>Piggot scoffed. At him! <i>How dare she?</i> "I'm sure that this will be well within your capabilities, Calvert. Now, I do need your input on this plan. I don't have the same view of this situation as you do. Do you think this will work?"</p>

<p>That seemed good enough to him, so he copied the response in the other timeline, to similar results (albeit with a moderately louder scoff). </p>

<p>"I'm not sure I've completely understood what you're doing," he said, hoping that it would come off as more of a lack of attention than anything else. "Could you summarize the general concept for me?"</p>

<p>"That's the <i>third time</i> you've asked for a summary now, Calvert. You're starting to make me doubt that you're up to this responsibility."</p>

<p>"It's, uh, just the wording that's getting to me," he said, hopeful.</p>

<p>"Fine. I will <i>completely rephrase</i> the summary for you. It's really not that complicated. As you're well aware, a recent parahuman trigger in the Bay has led to a complete destabilizing of the balance between gangs."</p>

<p><i>I didn't know that,</i> Thomas thought morosely.</p>

<p>Emily picked up a pen and circled (again) a location on what appeared to be a low-resolution printout of the Brockton Bay map. "This is the general vicinity of where we believe the parahuman first triggered. Anything more specific than that is <i>obviously</i> impossible to obtain right now, although I'm led to believe that there's a working group of thinkers who are attempting it."</p>

<p>As the director paused, Thomas looked out the window. His vantage point was rather poor, yet he could still see smoke rising from distant buildings. </p>

<p>"Regardless, what we do know is good enough. A parahuman triggered with the power to control the limbs of people meeting some as-of-yet unknown criteria. They can't control everyone, as evidenced by the infighting between Empire Eighty-Eight members yesterday, but their restrictions appear to be completely arbitrary thus far."</p>

<p>She stopped talking. Then her demeanour cracked, bit by bit. "I just-" she snorted- "I just ca-" a laugh, deeper this time- "can't, every time I think about that, the <i>pfft</i> chicken dance, oh," and then Thomas was watching as <i>Emily Piggot</i> broke into full-on laughter, holding her head with both hands.</p>

<p>Thomas waited patiently while she calmed down. He had to admit, he had been prepared for a lot of things, but this? This was truly baffling.</p>

<p>After what felt like an hour, Piggot stopped laughing, a tear still on one cheek. "My apologies. I think it's going to take some time to get over that. I'm surprised you can keep your composure so well."</p>

<p>"Thank you?"</p>

<p>"All right. In any case, humourous or not, this parahuman is a great concern to the power balance in Brockton Bay. If they continue this pattern of aggressively mocking the local gangs, we might see dangerous movements from the Empire and the- ah, Lung's group. Our best chance at preempting this is simple: we recruit this new parahuman himself."</p>

<p>Thomas frowned. It was hard to imagine. This local Protectorate hadn't successfully recruited an independent in a while, with even Shadow Stalker not being what he would term a proper 'recruitment'. "How do you plan to find them? From what I've heard, there's no pattern yet as to how they're gaining this control."</p>

<p>"So far, they've only targeted gang members. I've consulted with Armsmaster, and we've come to an agreement. The only way we hope to draw out a Master like this with any kind of reliability is to become a potential target - which is, as I'm sure you recall, the reason for your promotion. Congratulations, Calvert. You're our bait."</p>

<p>"I'm your- sorry, <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>Piggot leaned forward, smiling. Thomas could see her teeth, just barely, which made him more uneasy than he would have liked to admit. "Our <i>bait</i>, Calvert. We're going to piece together our <i>own</i> little gang, make a statement, and try to entice this Master with the most delicious team you could possibly imagine."</p>

<p>"Well, I-"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're so on board with this, Thomas. To be honest, this is the sort of risky move that can tank a career." Piggot leaned back in her chair. "If it wasn't you, it would have to be me, so I'm a bit relieved that you were okay to do it. No need to worry too much, though. If it doesn't pan out, we can set you up with a cozy retirement."</p>

<p>"Actually-"</p>

<p>"Anyways," she said, shuffling the papers on her desk around, "I've got another meeting in four minutes, which I rather need to prep for. I'll need you to report to the Protectorate Headquarters tomorrow to meet with Assault, who'll be leading the new pseudo-gang. You'll work with him to manage this, and who knows, if it goes well we might keep up the facade in the future."</p>

<p>"You know, this-"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Thomas, I really can't explain this to you any further. Send me an email if you need any further clarification."</p>

<p>Thomas sighed and stood up. He really missed being in control, having all the time in the world to deal with strange conversations and absurd decisions. In the end, he figured that it didn't really matter. If triggering his power again would undo this - or make it happen in an entirely different manner - he didn't have to worry <i>too</i> much about what occurred. Just sit back and smell the roses.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he went straight home. There was no hot meal waiting for him, but to his surprise there <i>was</i> half a pizza left over in the fridge. More than good enough.</p>

<p>In the other, and with not a small amount of trepidation, he returned to his underground base. Preliminary inspection gave no indication that anything was amiss compared to when he had, for lack of a better term, 'left' it. He still made calls to his three deputies before entering, fully suited up.</p>

<p>"We've confirmed the rumours of the probability-based precognitive, sir," Some Grunt said.</p>

<p>"Not now," Coil responded, sitting down at his desk and relishing the feeling of a non-plastic chair. "I have someone else I need you to locate for me."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Who is it?"</p>

<p>Coil closed his eyes - not that the grunt could see it - and massaged his forehead. What was it that Tattletale had told him, several timelines ago? <i>A trigger event at a local high school... Some place called Winslow High.</i></p>

<p>That was where all this insanity had started. And, if Coil's intuition was correct, that was where it would end, also.</p>

<p>"Bridges."</p>

<p>"It's Britters, sir."</p>

<p>"Britters, then. I need you to locate a student for me. They were... a student at Winslow High, less than a month ago." </p>

<p>"Understood, sir. Is there anything else to identify them by?"</p>

<p>This was where Coil had to hedge his bets. If activating his power could shift events further back in the past than that first point - when he'd first noticed something strange happening - it would become nearly impossible to pinpoint what certainties existed across timelines. If, on the other hand, he had accurately pinpointed the beginning, he could reliably come to an understanding of what was happening by just examining the differences since that point. "They were possibly bullied, maybe dropped out by now - but I'll let you figure that out. They're an ostracized student. One with <i>powers</i>."</p>

<p>The magic word. Britters nodded, and Coil could almost see the gears turning in the brain of his chief 'investigator'. </p>

<p>"And, Britters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"I only need a name."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

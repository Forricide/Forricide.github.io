<p>"Calvert. Calvert. Look at me. Thomas? Are you there?"</p>

<p>"Wh-oh, Piggot. I, uh, apologize for my lack of attentiveness."</p>

<p>Emily gave him a strange look. "Are you okay, Thomas? You've been acting weird all day."</p>

<p>All day. Right. What had happened? He'd split timelines, and then he was here in both of them. Director Emily <i>Piggot</i>'s office, with a suit and tie and... was that a badge on his lapel? Why, why yes, it was.</p>

<p>He felt at the badge idly with his left hand. It wasn't possible to tell exactly what it was without looking at it, but it seemed suspiciously similar to the one that Piggot herself was wearing, just with a bit less flair.</p>

<p>"I'm doing fine. Great, in fact. I'm just..." Thomas thought fast. Had he been promoted, somehow? Given a position in the PRT? The wrong turn of phrase could give away too much.</p>

<p>Then Thomas remembered he had two tries at this.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he shrugged. "It's a bit difficult to adapt. I've been in the same position for so long."</p>

<p>Piggot scoffed. At him! <i>How dare she?</i> "I'm sure that this will be well within your capabilities, Calvert. Now, I do need your input on this plan. I don't have the same view of this situation as you do. Do you think this will work?"</p>

<p>That seemed good enough to him, so he copied the response in the othertime, to similar results (albeit with a moderately louder scoff). </p>

<p>"I'm not sure I've completely understood what you're doing," he said, hoping that it would come off as more of a lack of attention than anything else. "Could you summarize the general concept for me?"</p>

<p>"That's the <i>third time</i> you've asked for a summary now, Calvert. You're starting to make me doubt that you're up to this responsibility."</p>

<p>"It's, uh, just the wording that's getting to me," he said, hopeful.</p>

<p>"Fine. I will <i>completely reword</i> the summary for you. It's really not that complicated. As you're well aware, a recent parahuman trigger in the Bay has led to a complete destabilizing of the balance between gangs."</p>

<p><i>I wasn't aware of that,</i> Coil thought morosely.</p>

<p>Emily picked up a pen and circled (again) a location on what appeared to be a low-resolution printout of the Brockton Bay map. "This is the general vicinity of where we believe the parahuman first triggered. Anything more specific than that is <i>obviously</i> impossible to obtain right now, although there is a litany of Thinkers working on that right now.</p>

<p>"What we do know is, this parahuman triggered with the power to control the limbs of people meeting some as-of-yet unknown criteria.</p>

<p><i>Dark, cold, suffocating. A wet variety of hypothermic coldness, bitterly disgusting; a cheimaphobe's nightmare.</i></p>

<p><i>Four walls press in, oppressive; metal scraping against skin, leaving deep impressions.</i></p>

<p><i>Veritable pounds of compacted trash muffle the sounds reverberating through the metal siding. It's still possible to make out laughter and voices, mocking tones; malefice.</i></p>

<p><i>There are bugs, so many bugs, crawling up and down skin; little feet traverse pores like relatively gigantic Mars rovers.</i></p>

<p><i>Rusty nails bite deep; they draw blood like sadistic nurses cosplaying Dracula.</i></p>

<p><i>About to scream; hopelessness finally sets in. That's when it happens.</i></p>

<p>"Perfect," Thomas said, saving the document. <i>Power Generation Ideas #88</i> was an excellent blend of your average potential trigger, perhaps claustrophobia related, with the additional complicating twist of outside factors - other people, aggressors, laughing and mocking the subject in the background. The concept was rather juvenile, so it was exactly the sort of trigger he'd expect from the rabble that made up Brockton Bay's general population.</p>

<p>He considered the various superpowers that might result from #88's trigger setup. A trash-related power could be somewhat poignant, but that would be a terrible idea overall. An idea for a breaker power (swapping between a mild-mannered teenager and a rusty locker at a moment's thought) was quickly discarded, as was the concept of a 'small spaces' tinker, and a stranger that was impossible to make friends with. After some rumination, he came up with something more unique, yet still fitting: bug control. An unimpressive power, of course, but maybe it could approach C-tier with a competent user.</p>

<p>Oh well. Coming up with the actual results of triggers had never quite been his forte. That's why his ideas always ended up on PHO, after light editing. Maybe <b>XxVoid_CowboyxX</b> would be able to come up with a good idea. Although the average internet forum user had an intellect that was barely a fraction of Thomas', "Void Cowboy" was the exception that proved the rule. One of the more prodigious users of the power generation subforum, it was always a treat for Thomas to read the savant's posts. Especially when it was Thomas himself providing some magnificent literature as fodder.</p>

<p><i>"Be my pet, be my pet..."</i></p>

<p><i>"Put my patronage to the test!"</i></p>

<p><i>"Tie a chain around your neck, chouchou..."</i></p>

<p>Ah, Thomas's - well, actually, Coil's - favourite ringtone. He picked up the phone, still typing idly with his other hand. It wouldn't do to give this particular caller too much of his (extremely valuable) attention. "Coil here, wassup?" </p>

<p>Coil pronounced 'wassup' with a nice little <i>h</i> sound at the start. It gave the word a little bit of pizzazz, and made him seem that much cooler. At least, that's what his mother had always said.</p>

<p>Before she died, of course. Coil felt a few strings in his chest tighten, somewhat close to his heart. Kidney strings. Those were difficult memories to stomach sometimes, that reminder of the mortality of his own person, foreshadowed by the deaths of his entire family in a shocking spontaneous tea kettle combustion.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the life insurance combined with a healthy will had been enough to jump start his career. He was sure his mother would be proud of him now, sitting in his own (custom designed!) desk in his own (super high tech!) office, holding back his own (trademarked!) maniacal cackle at his own absolutely perfect (technically legal!) underground base, and listening to - er, ignoring - his very own minion.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. His own minion.</p>

<p>"-obably a Thinker, given the circumstances. It might not be important, but I thought you would want to know."</p>

<p>"Hey, Tattletale?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Coil?"</p>

<p>"What's your favourite type of wood?"</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>He closed the timeline. It was almost like she didn't want a high-quality chair with his name embossed on it. Go figure.</p>

<p>This is where it might be important to note that Thomas was not your ordinary supervillain. Other than his sick mohawk and face that apparently looked like a certain popular actor, Thomas also had a brilliantly <i>awesome</i> superpower: he was able to split the universe in two, taking certain actions in one, and drinking excessive quantities of hard liquor in the other.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this power could be underwhelming at times. Just a few months ago, he had been carefully executing a plan in his <i>timeline A</i> (that was A as in Alpha, the first letter in the Greek alphabet, and the first main self-descriptor on his Tinder profile) when - at a quite unfortunate point in time - his computer had bluescreened, losing him a solid hour's work on his current project. He'd been prepared, however, and quickly saved the document in <i>timeline B</i> (that was B as in Booze, the first choice for a Friday evening, or Backup, something he should have done prior to updating that Oracle driver).</p>

<p>This, however, had left him with quite the dilemma. In Alpha, his plan had almost completed; in Backup, the plan was just as complete as his Armsmaster/Oni Lee ship-fic, but he had an extra two-hundred perfectly chosen words completed in the current scene. He was forced to make a difficult choice: Acquire a potentially game-changing superhuman asset... or complete a brilliant dialogue between a smitten criminal and his stoic, justice-driven nemesis? </p>

<p>He'd known what he'd had to do, then. And thankfully, he'd still been able to... <i>recruit</i> that parahuman just a few weeks later. Only fourteen tries - he'd made a little medal for his wall to commemorate that particular acquisition. ("This award presented to Coil by Thomas Calvert for not screwing up more than 15 times")</p>

<p>In the end, that acquisition had come in useful several times already, and was probably just about to call him again now. </p>

<p>Thankfully, the first time she'd called, it had been in Booze, so his two new timelines were both fresh, along with his mind. He picked up his vintage corded phone and pressed a quickdial button. </p>

<p>The ringtone only played for half a second. "I just-"</p>

<p>"So, Tattletale."</p>

<p>A sigh. "Yes, Coil?"</p>

<p>"I heard you had some information for me."</p>

<p>"...I just phoned you. In fact, I left a message." On the other end, Coil could hear a sigh, perhaps out of disappointment at missing her first chance to speak with him. Her fault, really, for not timing her call correctly.</p>

<p>"My sources are very reliable. But I'd still like to hear the information from you, if you would." The implication was, of course, that if she lied he'd <i>know</i>. It was important to keep his underlings in a constant state of slight fear. That made it harder for them to question him, and was also one of the first items in <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i>. He kept a hardcover copy in his desk. It was starting to fall apart, but he'd been using it less and less now that he had the majority of its contents memorized. He'd even successfully recommended it to Lung at one point, leading to a surge in power for the ABB, which would have been unfortunate if Coil hadn't received his $5 referral coupon.</p>

<p>"It's looking likely that there's been a trigger event at a local high school. Some place called Winslow High. A student was trapped in a locker for exactly three point one-four-one-five hours, before being released by the janitor. Apparently the locker was filled with some kind of biological waste, and my power seems to be suggesting that they are a prime candidate for a Mas-"</p>

<p>"Seems unlikely," Coil said, politely cutting her off.</p>

<p>"Why's that?"</p>

<p>"You say the locker was <i>filled with waste</i>, but also that there was a student trapped inside. How would that work, <i>hmmm</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, I mean-"</p>

<p>"Oh, unless you're attempting an analogy between trash and the tragic victims of Brockton Bay's general socioeconomic condition, of course. Not a very flattering comparison, Tattletale. Quite unkind."</p>

<p>"Actually, I just-"</p>

<p>"Really, I think I'm going to have to see the lot of you go through sensitivity training. Just another expense for me to pay for, isn't that right, Tattletale?"</p>

<p>"That seems-"</p>

<p>"I can't even force you to pay for it, because <i>employer regulations</i> and <i>business ethics</i>. What an absolute shame, that I have to pay out of pocket for <i>your</i> rude demeanour."</p>

<p>"You-"</p>

<p>He closed the timeline, and split again, already in relaxation mode.</p>

<p>So Tattletale thought that someone had 'probably' triggered at Winslow High. That meant, to his best estimate, that there was a solid five percent chance that such an event had occurred. </p>

<p>Out of curiosity, he played back the message his Tattletale had left in his original timeline, while taking a long sip of red wine.</p>

<p>"Coil. There's been an incident you should be aware of. A likely trigger event happened at Winslow High. They're suppressing it in the media, but it was pretty bad. I'll send you the details by email. If this person did trigger, my power tells me that they're probably a Shaker, given the circumstances. It might not be important, but I thought you would want to know."</p>

<p><i>Excellent.</i> Brockton Bay was a city with plenty of areas that would give a strategic advantage to almost any form of Shaker. If he wanted to make use of a funded parahuman gang in his more advanced plans, he'd need a parahuman that packed a punch - which Shakers frequently could - and the average student at a less economically privileged school like Winslow would be much easier to recruit. He could almost <i>feel</i> his plans coming together. Well, in that ten-percent world where Tattletale wasn't barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<p>As he turned back to his game of online poker, Coil couldn't help but pay attention to a small feeling of unease. That little, nagging sensation that there was something he'd missed, something just a little bit off about the conversation (or lack thereof) he'd had with Tattletale. Something about the message she'd left, that just didn't seem right.</p>

<p>Oh well. He was sure it wasn't anything important.</p>

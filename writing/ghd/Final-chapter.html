This time, her mask had several strangely placed holes: one in the middle of her forehead, revealing nothing but shadow; one on her left cheek, an eye bizarrely staring out; one where her mouth should have been, but there was only skin.</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">She was speaking, and he realized her mouth was visible through the top hole, only barely.</p></a>

She was above him, and it took him a second to realize she was <i>floating</i>, standing on a bizarre contraption that appeared to be old keyboards with their PS/2 cables plugged into an elderly woman who was hovering several metres above the ground. He wasn't sure what was more concerning: that the woman seemed to still be alive, or that - as far as he could tell - she was <i>enjoying</i> herself.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">The girl was holding a gun, and was looking straight at him.</p></a>

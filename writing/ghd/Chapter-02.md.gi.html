<p>Every time Coil split the universe, split fate, he also split his mind. Two brains thinking in what should have been parallel, but thanks to his immense genius, he was more than capable of diverging and thinking twice as much as normal. Lesser mortals would surely pale at the feats of intellect he was able to pull off: on one of his more inspired days, he'd successfully infiltrated the PRT not once, not twice, but <i>seven</i> times. It was true that each of these times, he entered with his fully cleared civilian identity, but that hardly diminished the achievement.</p>

<p>But now, even his most focused mind working at double speed wasn't enough to understand the current state of events.</p>

<p>"You're telling me that they're <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yessir. Done and dusted, as my mom used to say." </p>

<p>Before responding, Coil checked the caller information. <i>Cody Briggs</i>. It looked like somebody was receiving a pay cut. It was important to be perfectly respectful towards the greatest and most brilliant parahuman in the entirety of Brockton Bay. Also, he had the best hair, even if he'd woken up to find his mohawk mysteriously gone.</p>

<p>"Riddle me this, Bridges. If they're dead, then how is it that just yesterday, Tattletale herself briefed me on the results of the Lung encounter?"</p>

<p>"Dunno what to tell ya, boss. You saw the footage yesterday, nothing new since then."</p>

<p>Coil leaned forward over his desk. "...the footage?"</p>

<p>"Yessir. The one I showed ya yesterday, caught it with Leet's magic ball camera thingy."</p>

<p>Could Bridges know that Coil was watching- <i>no, that would be ridiculous.</i> "Which footage, Bridges?"</p>

<p>"Ya don't remember, boss?" </p>

<p>Ah, there it was. "Bridges, do you know how much footage my usel- er, minions send me to watch every day?"</p>

<p>"Uh, a lot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bridges. A very large amount. And most of it is completely uninformative. So tell me, Bridges, what footage did you send me?" <i>Patience, Calvert.</i></p>

<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line. "I sent it to ya on the information highway, boss. Internet mail with the subject, er, 'Shocking footage inside! Must watch! NSFL'. That ring a bell?"</p>

<p>Coil sighed and hung up the phone. Surprisingly, the email was indeed in his inbox, and marked as read. <i>Probably just an anti-spam measure.</i> </p>

<p>He clicked on the video attachment and pressed <b>play</b>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A figure, lying prone on a dilapidated building, was watching the street below. They were wearing navy army fatigues and a gas mask. This was, quite frankly, understandable in Brockton Bay - the streets never smelled particularly pleasant.</p>

<p>Although roof-sitting was, as far as Coil was aware, a common pastime for the plebeian population of Brockton Bay, this particular peasant appeared to have a different reason entirely for their penchant for patient purview. Just in frame, in the streets below, a particular Asian gang leader was visible, speaking with several men who were presumably his subordinates.</p>

<p>The camera's microphone was apparently just good enough to pick up snippets of the conversation. It was Lung, speaking in a fairly calm tone of voice: "...the children, just shoot.  Doesnâ€™t matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot-" </p>

<p>Coil muted the speakers. Now that was quite unpleasant. Still, if what Goot had told him was true, things were only going to get worse from here.</p>

<p>Lung continued gesturing for a few seconds, then turned away</p>

<p>Even the most conservative historian would surely put down Coil as one of the most genius villains of all time. No, scratch that. Any historian would surely put him down as one of the most brilliant <i>humans</i> of all time. </p>

<p>This was simply fact: His genius couldn't even be expressed in terms constrained by the insufficient English language. Perhaps - one day - his followers would create an entirely new dialect (or language, even) simply to speak of him properly.</p>

<p>Oh well. Coil was a pragmatic person; he didn't have time for far-off thoughts like that. He had three supervillain teams to manage, information to gather, children to kidnap, cities to conquer...</p>

<p>"Does he always do this?" someone of little relevance asked, evidently not realizing that Coil was currently performing a <i>reflection</i>, and thus should never be interrupted by a mere mortal.</p>

<p>In truth, Coil hadn't thought that there was any way his plan could come together better. That had been before he'd received an internal briefing just a few minutes ago, courtesy of his brand-new status as an acting deputy director. It hadn't exactly been full of information, but what little offerings it did contain were mission critical: The entirety of the local Protectorate team, not including the four capes under his purview, was going to be undertaking a top-secret mission today.</p>

<p>That is, at the exact same time as his team had been planning a bank robbery. Sure, he didn't know what exactly this "top-secret mission" entailed, but the chances that they would be anywhere near the bank were, in Coil's opinion, astronomically low. </p>

<p>"How would I know, Aegis? I barely know the guy."</p>

<p>Aegis frowned. "But at the last meeting, you two seemed like friends."</p>

<p>If the majority of the Protectorate was off gallivanting on some random mission, and the dregs were all occupied at the bank... then the chances of his minions successfully pulling off the kidnapping <i>skyrocketed</i>.</p>

<p>Maybe he'd be preserving this continuity, after all. It was like the universe was going out of its way to align itself in his favour.</p>

<p>"Nah, I've just met him a couple times. I like the way he thinks, though."</p>

<p>Thomas had deliberated long and hard over how to use his second timeline in this continuity. He'd had very good fortune in the two timelines still just barely staying synchronous after his meeting with Emily Piggot; since then, he'd managed to keep them relatively aligned, although he was having difficulties replicating his actions perfectly across both timelines. Thankfully, this wasn't that big of a problem when interacting with his well-trained underlings.</p>

<p>And, of course, it didn't matter what any other Brockton Bay detritus thought of him. </p>

<p>"Sorry I'm late, everybody," Velocity said, walking in the door. "Heavy traffic this morning. They really need to expand West Eighteenth to two lanes both ways, right? Right."</p>

<p>"I'm amazed by your continued employment," Thomas said. He arranged some papers in front of him. They were all blank, but had been slightly out of alignment. </p>

<p>He'd had to prepare this room in a hurry. </p>

<p>At last, he would see victory.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm sure you all would like to know why I've called you here today," Thomas said.</p>

<p>Assault held up a sheet. "I already read over the agenda, can I go?"</p>

<p>"No. First item: payment. Robbing a bank isn't extremely lucrative, but you should be making it away with several thousand dollars. As I have noted, you'll be splitting whatever you gain at the bank evenly among yourselves-"</p>

<p>"Wait, we're keeping the money?" Aegis frowned, shuffling around on his seat. For some reason, he'd ended up with the lawn chair again. Thomas wasn't quite sure why this office had one of those in the first place. "I thought this was - you know, a staged robbery. Faked for publicity. So we could give back the money after. So it wouldn't be, you know, <i>illegal</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," Assault said, "we <i>could</i>, but then we'd have less money. And besides, then it would seem like insurance fraud. The bank could lose money! Not a good look for them. Splitting the money really just keeps everyone's best interests in mind."</p>

<p>"Including your own?"</p>

<p>"Yep, you hit the nail on the head. Of course, if you don't want your share, I'll happily take it off your hands -"</p>

<p>"Um, sorry, can we start planning the actual robbery? I think, you know, the more time we have, the better," Dauntless said. "It's a little, er, stressful to think about going in unprepared."</p>

<p>"Fine," said Thomas. "It's not that complicated of a plan. Dauntless, you'll use your sword - or lance, whatever it is - to break down the back door to the bank. Once you're inside, Dauntless, Aegis, and Assault will use their powers to break into anything that looks like it might contain money. You'll place it into these huge duffel bags marked with convenient dollar signs, and have Dauntless carry them on his spear-thing, like a Tom Sawyer kind of deal. In the meantime, Velocity will take the current patrons of the bank hostage, to prevent any <i>heroic interference</i>."</p>

<p>"Wait, how?"</p>

<p>"How what?"</p>

<p>"How will I take them hostage? I mean, my power doesn't really do much to crowds. Do you want me to just, I don't know, run around them to make them dizzy?"</p>

<p>"What? No," Thomas said, "that would be ridiculous. And messy. You'll use a gun, it's much more effective, less tiring, and unlikely to cause anyone to vomit."</p>

<p>Aegis shook his head. "A gun? We can't use <i>those</i>. That would break the unwritten rules."</p>

<p>Thomas sighed. It was like none of them had been paying attention. Except perhaps Assault, who was already standing in front of the room's gun locker, fiddling with the padlock. "The entire point of this exercise is to draw the attention of a vigilante. Velocity bringing a gun to make him actually useful is really just killing two birds with one stone. Er, metaphorical killing, of course. The PRT wouldn't look kindly on actual murder."</p>

<p>"Sounds fine to me." Assault handed a rifle over to Velocity, who shrugged and grabbed it. "What else? Just a standard smash and grab?"</p>

<p>"Standard? You haven't done this sort of thing before, right?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>"Nah, of course not. I read up on it in case it was ever necessary, though."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Banks, Businesses, and Basements: The Burglar's Guide to Standard Buildings</i>?" asked Thomas.</p>

<p>"You got it! I don't read for pleasure, but I could have made an excuse for that one. Great book, the author really knew how to make lockpicking interesting."</p>

<p>"I, uh, think we're getting a little off-topic, here," Dauntless said. "Can't we stick to planning? I'm still not feeling ready to actually, ah, rob a bank."</p>

<p>"Buck up, kid," said Assault. "You're an adult, you'll need to figure this out sometime or another. It's a part of growing up."</p>

<p>Any further comments (specifically by Aegis, who had chosen the wrong time to attempt to interject) were stopped by Thomas: "Let me be clear. None of <i>you</i> are planning anything. You will follow the plan <i>I</i> laid out for you, which is - as is every plan I create - perfectly simple, straightforward, and easy to implement. Now, are there any questions?"</p>

<p>"Actually-"</p>

<p>"Excellent. Then, this meeting is adjourned. Assault, you're responsible for texting me when you arrive at the bank. Keep me updated, where appropriate."</p>

<p>And then, before any of the heroes really knew what was going on, Thomas had already left the room.</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't really expecting much planning to be necessary anyways. Robbing a bank can't be that hard," said Assault.</p>

<p>Velocity stood up. "Do you think I get to keep the gun?"</p>

<p>"Probably not."</p>

<p>In the van, halfway to the bank, Aegis finally tried again:</p>

<p>"Uh, the bank is the other way."</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Thomas covertly pulled his secret phone out from a suit pocket. Nobody else was nearby, but you could never be too careful. Turning it on, he found over four hundred unread messages and missed calls. A little odd, but nothing he couldn't put off until later.</p>

<p>He entered a series of digits that could be interpreted by some as a phone number. Those who <i>wouldn't</i> interpret it as a phone number were, in fact, unlikely to be familiar with phone numbers in the first place.</p>

<p>Right. He entered a phone number, tapping his foot eight and a half times before the recipient picked up on the first ring.</p>

<p>"Rosina speaking," came a deep voice.</p>

<p>"Snake here," Coil responded, and hus his extremely secure protocol was thusly completed. He didn't actually remember where the code names had come from, but he was sure it had been exceedingly clever at the time. "You will carry out Operation Homeschooling, starting now."</p>

<p>"Affirmative, sir."</p>

<p>He hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Fate was, in fact, on his side. Everything was going perfectly according to plan.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Finally, as he watched the four leave to go perfect his master plan, Coil selected a contact from a long list on his phone.</p>

<p>It rang once.</p>

<p>"Ah, Shelby, you're-"</p>

<p><i>"They're here! How is he managing this? The legs, why won't they stop kicking, they're- agh!"</i></p>

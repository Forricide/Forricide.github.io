<p>Even the most apathetic, conservative historian would surely put down Coil as one of the most genius villains of all time. No, scratch that. Any historian would surely put him down as one of the most brilliant <i>humans</i> of all time. </p>

<p>This was simply fact: His genius couldn't even be expressed in terms constrained by the insufficient English language. Perhaps - one day - his followers would create an entirely new dialect (or language, even) simply to speak of him properly.</p>

<p>Oh well. Coil was a pragmatic person; he didn't have time to deliberate on the future like that. He had three supervillain teams to manage, information to gather, children to kidnap, cities to conquer...</p>

<p>"Does he always do this?" someone of little relevance asked, evidently not realizing that Coil was currently performing a <i>reflection</i>, and thus should never be interrupted by a mere mortal.</p>

<p>In truth, Coil hadn't thought that there was any way his plan could come together better. That had been before he'd received an internal briefing just a few minutes ago, courtesy of his brand-new status as an acting deputy director. It hadn't exactly been full of information, but what little offerings it did contain were mission critical: The entirety of the local Protectorate team, not including the four capes under his purview, was going to be undertaking a top-secret mission today.</p>

<p>That is, at the exact same time as his team had been planning a bank robbery. Sure, he didn't know what exactly this "top-secret mission" entailed, but considering he hadn't told anyone about his plan, he doubted that their mission would be related. With any luck, the Protectorate would be striking at the Merchants, far off at the docks. Regardless, the chances that they would be anywhere near the bank were, in Coil's opinion, astronomically low.  </p>

<p>"How would I know, Aegis? I barely know the guy."</p>

<p>Aegis frowned. "But at the last meeting, you two seemed like friends."</p>

<p>If the majority of the Protectorate was off gallivanting on some random mission, and the dregs were all occupied at the bank... then the chances of his minions successfully pulling off the kidnapping <i>skyrocketed</i>.</p>

<p>Maybe he'd be preserving this continuity, after all. It was like the universe was going out of its way to align itself in his favour. <i>With luck like this, who needs powers?</i></p>

<p>"Nah, I've just met him a couple times. I like the way he thinks, though." Assault tapped his forehead. "Great minds think alike."</p>

<p>Thomas had deliberated long and hard over how to make use of his two realities within this continuity. He'd had very good fortune in managing to keep the two worlds synchronous after his meeting with Emily Piggot; since then, he hadn't had to work that hard to keep them relatively aligned, although he was having difficulties replicating his actions perfectly within both realities. Thankfully, this wasn't that big of a problem when interacting with his well-trained underlings.</p>

<p>And, of course, it didn't matter what any other Brockton Bay detritus thought of him. </p>

<p>"Sorry I'm late, everybody," Velocity said, walking in the door. "Heavy traffic this morning. They really need to expand West Eighteenth to two lanes both ways, right? Right."</p>

<p>"I'm amazed by your continued employment," Thomas said. He arranged some papers in front of him. They were all blank, but had been slightly out of alignment, and it was important to look professional.</p>

<p>He'd had to prepare this room in a hurry. The meeting room that he'd previously been using in the PRT headquarters had been requisitioned by human resources, who were apparently scrambling for space for onboarding interviews, or something ridiculous like that. It was a minor roadblock, but frustrating nonetheless. Thankfully, he'd discovered a new startup that was apparently offering short-term office space rentals; they'd been more than happy to rent a meeting room to Thomas for a couple hours. And for an absurdly low price, at that. </p>

<p>Thomas may have been the most wealthy man in Brockton Bay, but he didn't get there by wasting money. He still saved coupons for his groceries, like any sensible member of society.  </p>

<p>And if this went according to plan, well... money would cease to be even an arbitrary constraint. The city would fall within weeks; the country, within a year. He would seize control of fate itself, and wield it as its master! At last, <i>he would see victory!</i></p>

<p>Thomas let out an incredibly evil chuckle. Nobody said anything.</p>

<p>Dauntless tapped his foot.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm sure you would all like to know why I've called you here today," Thomas said, finally.</p>

<p>Assault held up a sheet. "I already read over the agenda, can I go get started?"</p>

<p>"No. First item: payment. Robbing a bank isn't extremely lucrative, but you should be getting away with several thousand dollars. As I have noted in section ten-point-eight, you'll be splitting whatever you gain at the bank evenly among yourselves-"</p>

<p>"Wait, we're keeping the money?" Aegis frowned, shuffling around on his seat. For some reason, he'd ended up with a lawn chair again. Thomas wasn't quite sure why this office had one of those in the first place. "I thought this was - you know, a staged robbery. Faked for publicity. So we could give back the money after. So it wouldn't be, you know, <i>illegal</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," Assault said, "we <i>could</i>, but then we'd have less money. And besides, then it would seem like insurance fraud. The bank could lose money! Not a good look for them. Splitting the money really just keeps everyone's best interests in mind."</p>

<p>"Including your own?"</p>

<p>"Yep, you hit the nail on the head. Of course, if you don't want your share, I'll happily take it off your hands -"</p>

<p>"Um, sorry, can we start planning the actual robbery? I think, you know, the more time we have, the better," Dauntless said. "It's a little, er, stressful to think about going in unprepared."</p>

<p>"Fine," said Thomas. "It's not that complicated of a plan. Dauntless, you'll use your sword - or lance, whatever it is, I don't care - to break down the back door to the bank. Once you're inside, Dauntless, Aegis, and Assault will use their powers to break into anything that looks like it might contain money. You'll place it into these huge duffel bags marked with convenient dollar signs, and have Dauntless carry them on his spear-thing, like a Tom Sawyer kind of deal. In the meantime, Velocity will take the current patrons of the bank as hostages, to prevent any <i>heroic interference</i>."</p>

<p>"Wait, what?"</p>

<p>"Velocity - that's you, just to be clear," Thomas said slowly, "will take the patrons of the bank - that's the people inside the building - as <i>hostages</i>. It's not that difficult of a concept."</p>

<p>"How am I supposed to take them hostage? I mean, my power doesn't really do much to crowds. Do you want me to just, I don't know, run around them to make them dizzy?"</p>

<p>"What? No," said Thomas, "that would be ridiculous. And messy. You'll use a gun. It's much more effective, less tiring, and unlikely to cause anyone to vomit. Which would be disgusting."</p>

<p>Aegis shook his head. "A gun? We can't use <i>those</i>. That would break the unwritten rules."</p>

<p>Thomas sighed. It was like none of them had been paying attention. Except perhaps Assault, who was already standing in front of the gun locker Thomas had brought along with him, fiddling with its padlock. "The entire point of this exercise is to draw the attention of a vigilante. Velocity bringing a gun to make him actually useful is really just killing two birds with one stone. Er, metaphorical killing, of course. I'd prefer you avoid actually murdering anyone, the paperwork would be horrendous."</p>

<p>"Sounds fine to me." Assault handed a rifle over to Velocity, who shrugged and grabbed it. "What else? Just a standard smash and grab?"</p>

<p>"Standard? You haven't done this sort of thing before, right?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>"Nah, of course not. Do I look like a villain to you? I read up on it in case it was ever necessary, though."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Banks, Businesses, and Basements: The Burglar's Guide to Standard Building Layouts</i>?" asked Thomas.</p>

<p>"You got it! I don't read for pleasure, but I could have made an excuse for that one. Great book, the author really knew how to make lockpicking interesting."</p>

<p>"I, uh, think we're getting a little off-topic, here," Dauntless said. "Can't we stick to planning? I'm still not feeling ready to actually, ah, rob a bank."</p>

<p>"Buck up, kid," said Assault. "You're an adult, you'll need to figure this out sometime or another. It's a part of growing up."</p>

<p>Any further comments (specifically by Aegis, who had chosen the wrong time to attempt to interject) were stopped by Thomas: "Let me be clear. None of <i>you</i> are planning anything. You will follow the plan <i>I</i> laid out for you, which is - as is every plan I create - perfectly simple, straightforward, and easy to implement. Now, are there any questions?"</p>

<p>"Actually-"</p>

<p>"Excellent. Then, this meeting is adjourned. Assault, you're responsible for texting me when you arrive at the bank, using this perfectly legal burner phone I've procured for you. Keep me updated, where appropriate."</p>

<p>And then, before any of the heroes really knew what was going on, Thomas had already left the room.</p>

<p>For a few moments, nobody said anything. Velocity was sipping from a cup of complimentary coffee, counting the tiles on the ceiling; Aegis had almost finished reading over the briefing document for a fourth time, trying to understand how he was going to pitch this to his community service coordinator. Dauntless was tapping both feet at a frantic pace, only staying balanced through careful use of his Arclance.</p>

<p>"Well," Assault said, breaking the silence, "I wasn't really expecting much planning to be necessary anyways. Robbing a bank can't be that hard. High school drop outs do it all the time."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a high school drop out," Aegis said morosely.</p>

<p>Velocity finished his coffee, leaving the empty cup on top of the machine. "Do you think I get to keep the gun?"</p>

<p>"Probably not."</p>

<p>In their unmarked van, ten minutes before they'd scheduled the break-in, Aegis watched Velocity argue with Assault over how they'd divide the money. They'd rebuffed his last four attempts to interject, but he gave it one more try, and finally succeeded:</p>

<p>"Uh, the bank is the other way."</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Thomas covertly pulled his secret phone out from a suit pocket. Nobody else was nearby, but you could never be too careful. Turning it on, he found over four hundred unread messages and missed calls. A little out of the ordinary, but nothing he couldn't put off until later.</p>

<p>He entered a series of digits that could be interpreted by some as a phone number. Those who <i>wouldn't</i> interpret it as a phone number were, in fact, unlikely to be familiar with phone numbers in the first place.</p>

<p>Right. He entered a phone number, pacing back and forth three times before the recipient picked up on the first ring.</p>

<p>"Rosina speaking," came a deep voice.</p>

<p>"Snake here," Coil responded, and his extremely secure protocol was thusly completed. He didn't actually remember where the code names had come from, but he was sure it had been exceedingly clever at the time. "You will carry out Operation Homeschooling, starting now."</p>

<p>"Affirmative, sir."</p>

<p>He hung up the phone. In a nearby suburb, a Toyota minivan parked overnight would suddenly be bustling with activity, ten of his finest underlings emerging from their perfect disguise to carry out his orders.</p>

<p>Fate was, in fact, on his side. Everything was going perfectly according to plan.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>A small sound alerted Thomas to a new text.</p>

<p><i>at bank. start?</i></p>

<p>In that reality, he responded: <i>go now</i></p>

<p>In the other, it took another two minutes to receive the text from Assault. He couldn't imagine why. Regardless, that fit well with what he was planning, regardless. He didn't respond, waiting as he placed a call in the first reality.</p>

<p><i>"Sir."</i></p>

<p>"MacArthur. What is the status of the bank robbery?"</p>

<p><i>"There's a strange man in a suit holding up the bank with a hunting rifle. I'm not sure how long he'll manage to keep everyone from running. He looks a bit ridiculous,"</i> the man replied. He'd never even questioned why Coil had sent him to stake out the bank, or how he had known there would be a robbery. Coil loved professionals. <i>"Otherwise, the police department has a few cars outside, but they're staying well back. The PRT isn't here yet."</i></p>

<p>In other words: No problems yet. Thomas grinned. "Perfect. I will call you again in ten minutes."</p>

<p><i>stay in the van for now</i>, he responded in the other reality.</p>

<p>He leaned back in an office chair, smiling. Ten minutes ago, he'd successfully taken his revenge on human resources by commandeering one of the nicest offices using a little-known bug in the scheduling system. He suspected this might lead to them finally figuring it out, but it was well worth it to see the face on the secretary as he picked up his key card. </p>

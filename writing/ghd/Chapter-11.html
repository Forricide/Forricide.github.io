<p class="content-paragraph">"Please turn to chapter three - that's page eighty-two - and read the section <i>On Acquiring Funds in a Sufficiently Legal Manner</i>."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Dinah - well, <i>Darth Cassandra</i> - found the page after a few moments of searching. In between deep, strangely labourious breaths, she spoke: "This segment is inoperative. Lawfulness is not a desideratum for a (flagitious) Lord."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil blinked once, behind his mask. "Ah, well, it may seem strange currently, but you'll quickly discover that legitimate money is orders of magnitude more valuable than illegally acquired funds."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>hppph</i>, Cassandra breathed, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">She did appear to be reading the chapter (not that Coil could tell behind that mask), so he considered it a success. Coil himself had benefited greatly from this particular segment; some of the tips on insurance fraud had been perfect to jumpstart his career.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He still wasn't quite sure how Cassandra's power worked. He knew she was a precognitive, and his notes from this continuity had small bits of elaboration on that; but, if she could see the future, why hadn't she done the prep work on capital gains tax calculations he'd assigned? </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He'd tried to ask her, but she'd just said: <i>"Eighty percent chance you should just figure it out yourself."</i> What was that even supposed to mean? Had that been what the youth called a <i>diss</i>? </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>Children can be such a pain</i>, he mused. Perhaps for his next protégé, he would choose someone more manageable - a teenager, perhaps. Surely a somewhat older protégé would be more mature.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil leaned back in his chair, taking the opportunity to relax this body. Even after the past several days, he was still adjusting to the need to keep his realities going as long as possible. After accidentally closing one reality, he couldn't risk doing anything that would lead to another loss.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">That being said, one of his worlds had a kill order on his head and the entire Protectorate (save the heroes he'd assassinated) gunning for him. In hindsight, bombing the Protectorate Headquarters might have been going a bit too far.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">But, that was fine. Sixteen - well, fifteen - worlds was plenty; he could afford to lose one, or two, or three. He wasn't making any mistakes in <i>this</i> one, after all.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Done reading already?" he asked a few minutes later, after Cassandra had turned the page twice.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"I am..." <i>hppph</i> "- illuminated."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"> </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Very good. I've had an assignment left for you in your study room. Tomorrow, we'll get practical, and open your first offshore bank account."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thus dismissed, Cassandra left the room, and Coil took a moment to push in the chairs before returning to his office. There were several <i>supervillain</i> things to do today, of course; he couldn't always be a fount of wisdom.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">  </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In this continuity, it seemed that he'd never completed his most recent 'literary exploration'. Only two chapters of his Oni Lee/Armsmaster romance novella had been completed, and from what he could tell, his alternate-continuity self had simply ran out of motivation. Clearly, a weaker man than this Coil, who would easily-</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">The phone rang in another reality.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Across realities, Coil collectively sighed. Like a regular sigh, but fifteen times more frustrated.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In that world, he picked up the phone.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sir, I have an urgent update for you."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil leaned back in his desk. He already had his notes out, phone at the ready - this was, after all, his <i>urgent updates</i> reality, commandeered after he'd ran out of liquor. "Go on."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"After the bank incident the other week, your Undersiders apparently chose to hide the cash in a warehouse in disputed territory."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Certainly sounds like something Tattletale would do," Coil said. When he'd had her apartment searched, he'd found notes she'd made on how to kill him sitting on her desk. He'd made sure to point out some of the (many) flaws. <i>Shoot him while monologuing</i>? That was a crime that bordered on the absurd! She had been much better educated on the unwritten rules after that incident.   </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Indeed, sir. But it appears that you-know-which-gang may have acquired that money."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Colour me shocked," Coil said, decidedly not shocked. "How might <i>that gang</i> have managed such a feat?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I imagine they cut the lock, sir."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"What a terribly difficult thing for a large, well-connected gang to do," said Coil.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Indeed, sir. But I am afraid that was not the bad news."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Did Tattletale accidentally get herself killed by directly confronting a seven-foot-tall pyrokinetic brute that happens to have difficulties controlling their anger?" </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Unfortunately, it is much worse, sir. The Undersiders are currently in combat with that very gang's tinker, whose specialization is</i> bombs<i>."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil frowned. This wasn't ideal, but he doubted the exact same scenario was happening in every one of his realities - he could always give up the Undersiders in this one if necessary. Of course, that was as long as the Hebert girl - her cape name was <i>Worker Ant</i> for some unfathomable reason - didn't die. "As long as the power booster survives, I believe all outcomes should be acceptable," he said.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Well, that's exactly the problem, sir. She's still with the Undersiders - physically present with them, I mean, not in terms of membership - fighting that gang."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"What? Why!?" Her ability that improved other parahuman powers lasted for several hours; she was a backline cape, where 'back' generally referred to 'back at home, eating lasagna and not fighting dangerous enemies'.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Quite frankly, sir, I haven't the foggiest."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Well, get her out of there. Send two teams immediately, and focus on extraction. If you can help the others, do so, but focus on getting Worker Ant out." Perhaps he'd have a second protégé by the end of the day. "And do tell them to avoid getting blown up."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Very well, sir. I'll pass that on."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">After hanging up the phone, Coil leaned back in his chair, massaging his right hand. In one of the worlds he was in, at least. He had essentially lost track at this point, and had resorted to writing an identifier on his arm in each reality. It got him a few strange looks, but it was better than trying to show up to work at the PRT building in the reality where he'd had it demolished.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Although Coil was a rather practical, rational-minded being, he had to admit that he did find himself prone - in exceedingly rare situations - to a tad bit of stress. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">His heart wasn't racing, of course (in fact, he'd been told several times he didn't even have one); no butterflies were present in his stomach (the filtration system took care of those); his thinking was hardly impaired (he'd be a genius with even half his current brainpower, so it didn't really matter) - and yet, some small part of himself was <i>worried</i>. Worried that this extraction would go wrong. Worried that <i>that gang</i> would get her hands on his new favourite underling. Worried that he wouldn't be able to get another power boost.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"> </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In one world, he stood up from a park bench. Something above the movement was reassuring; maybe it was the calming effect of not-quite-exercise - or maybe how he got a slightly better view of the smouldering detritus that was once the PRT headquarters.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He was still <i>worried.</i> Worried that he'd lose his newfound freedom.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Freedom?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">That was nonsensical. He was already <i>free</i>; if losing the power boost in one reality caused a cascade to occur, he could simply reactivate his power and hunt for another usable continuity. There was no reason to feel this much stress over such ephemeral acquisitions - right? His successes in this continuity had hardly even been <i>his</i> in the first place; a past self he'd never been had recruited Dinah and Worker Ant, and his sixteen realities had been practically handed to him on a platter.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">There was no reason to feel anxious over losing this reality. No reason to concern himself with losing access to the largest power advantage he'd ever had. No reason to worry about failing his protégé, who could cease to exist at his whim.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil considered these thoughts.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>No.</i> He couldn't take that risk. He couldn't lose this world, this continuity.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">A moment later, he had left his office behind, moving forward in four realities to take a hallway to another section of his base.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Cassandra's lair was located deeper into the base than Coil's office, but the two were not that far away; with his long footsteps, it wasn't long before Coil arrived at the doorway. Cassandra didn't seem to stay at the base past mid-afternoon, despite his excellent dinner plans, so he made sure to get her lessons in before then. It had been surprisingly relaxing, to pass on his vast knowledge to a young pupil. Perhaps, in a sense, he'd been investing in the future.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>hppph</i> "What is it you want, lowling?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Cassandra. I apologize for interrupting your studies-" he noted with some approval that she had been reading <i>The Hunger Games</i>, a popular how-to for managing teenager bloodthirst in post-apocalyptic environments- "but I have need of your precognition."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">She held out her left hand, flipping a page with her right.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He paused. "I have a few questions for you..."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Cassandra made a grabby motion with her hand, still not looking up. <i>hppph</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil sighed and tossed her the thesaurus he'd been holding behind his back.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">She caught it with surprising dexterity, and flipped seemingly at random to a page. "Approved. One inquiry."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Which questions to ask deserved consideration. A selfless question could be of immediate help to the Undersiders; a selfish question would seek to assuage his anxiety. A difficult moral dilemma. Thankfully, Coil did not have morals, which made such dilemmas rather trivial.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"What is the probability that my power collapses if I don't get another boost from Worker Ant?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Cassandra flipped a page in her book for dramatic effect.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil waited patiently. In retrospect, he should have left the lessons on theatrical posturing until later in the curriculum.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"The numbers-" Cassandra flipped through her thesaurus- "mutate. Thirteen, thirty-three, three hundred."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, are those percentages, or-"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Divination: Describing Destiny (A thesis on Precognitive Powers)</i>, appendix B, paragraph ten: Parahumans with abilities related to precognition often interfere with other similar powers, leading to powers failing, producing incorrect predictions or information, and-slash-or directly and brutally murdering the parahuman."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Actually, that last part isn't in-"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"My power has been producing erroneous results since yesterday." Cassandra flipped through her thesaurus. "This is disquieting."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Well, I really don't think you're going to die if we try one more question."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Cassandra stared at him. Or so he imagined. It was hard to tell what she was doing behind the mask. "A vast scarlet ocean. Inconsolable wailing: a grief-stricken entity of indeterminate identity groans a single time, then collapses."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Did- did your power show you that?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"It is a fabrication." Cassandra tilted her head slightly. "I am proud of it."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"That doesn't really help me with my problems," Coil said, a tad petulant.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"I cannot envisage your soul, Coil, but I can give wisdom: Sometimes, you must be the one to help yourself. (Hellsworth, Sam. <i>Achieving Auto-Mental Augmentation</i>. New York, All American Press, 2007.)" </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>Help myself?</i> Coil thought. Wasn't that what he was already doing? He was making use of resources to solve... no, he had been trying to reassure himself. On the one hand, it was somewhat pathetic to take self-improvement advice from a child; on the other hand, he had already been trying to do that.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In another reality, he was on the phone. He'd made the mistake - clear in retrospect, now - of rarely interacting with the Undersiders in any of his worlds, early on. Their actions had stayed roughly synced, to the extent that they'd all ended up engaged with <i>that gang</i>'s supposed bomb tinker - Bakuda, whatever that meant - around the same time. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Except in the reality where he'd destroyed the PRT, of course. The Undersiders were <i>long</i> gone in that particular one. Fortunately, Worker Ant had been amenable to a contract to renew her power's effect in return for also burning down Winslow High. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"CS," Coil said, "What's going on? Give me the big picture."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"> </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"The Undersiders are barely surviving at this point. We've started providing cover fire under your instructions, but at this distance, it's unlikely we'll achieve anything."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">A bead of sweat rolled down the side of Coil's face. Well, Thomas' face, actually. Coil was only the mask that hid his complex inner self.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"What about the team that went to extract, ah, Worker Ant?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"They were doing quite well, until half of them were literally turned into jelly, and the other half had it happen figuratively."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil's hand mysteriously banged against the wall.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Give me the play by play, CS."  </p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Hm. Bakuda is screaming something about how intelligent she is; Tattletale keeps turning back to respond. Grue is doing something with his darkness that's trying to smother them, I think. Ah, I see, they have a shot now. Hellhound's ATVs have just shown up."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Her <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"ATVs. You're surely familiar with that little power interaction, no?"</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, yes, certainly," Coil said, walking back towards his office. "Worker Ant, CS. Is she alive?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Sure is, if the screaming is any indication. I think one of the bombs clipped her."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Do we have any men in the area? This is an emergency. If necessary, attempt to execute Bakuda."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I'm the only one left. I am a good shot, though, sir. Always happy to end a life; that's the mercenary guarantee."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil paused.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Fifteen minds thought in concert.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">What would this lead to? An escalation, surely - against his forces, if anyone ever figured it out, or just within the city, if it was assumed some disgruntled individual had done it.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He could handle escalation, though. He was the best villain in the city, when it came to that.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Were there any other possible downsides?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In thirteen additional worlds, he was already dialing CS.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Ouch, she just drove over a gang member with her jeep. That looks like it hurt."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In fourteen realities, Coil said the same thing.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Do it."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">The gun's report echoed over the phone, uncomfortably loud.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Bakuda is down. The Undersiders appear to be escaping."</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Whatever fallout this caused, Coil was prepared to deal with it. There was, really, nothing that could make him risk losing access to this continuity. If he had it his way, he'd never use his power again.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Coil glanced around. That seemed like the sort of thought that would tempt fate, if only a little.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">But nothing happened. Nobody came barging in to his office; no urgent alerts popped up on his computer screen. His phone stayed mercifully silent, as it had been ever since he dropped it in a glass of orange juice.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Nothing happened.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Finally, Coil relaxed, leaning back in all fifteen worlds. This was the kind of life that he deserved.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Of course, that was when his base blew up.</p>

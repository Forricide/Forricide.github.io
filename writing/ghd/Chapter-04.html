<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">"Calvert. Hello, Calvert? Look at me." </p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">His vision swam, eyes adjusting to the sudden fluorescent glare. This was exactly why his underground base only used mood lighting.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">"Thomas? Are you all right?"</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"Wh-oh, ah, Director Piggot." He adjusted his glasses. "I, uh, apologize for my lack of attentiveness."</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">The head of the local PRT gave him a strange look. "Are you feeling well, Thomas? I know it's a lot to go through, but you've seemed a bit out of it this entire meeting."</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">This meeting. Right. What just happened? </p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">Just moments ago, he had been comfortably sitting at his forty-five thousand dollar ergonomic standing desk, in his custom-designed feng shui-optimized office, alone. He had activated his power, splitting the universe into two realities, ostensibly to investigate the possibility of his power causing small but observable differences in continuity. It had been the most simple conceivable test.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Now, without so much as getting out of his chair, he was halfway across the city. Somehow, at that exact same moment Thomas had activated his powers, he had been moved to an entirely different location - and ended up, <i>within both realities</i>, sitting in a plastic cafeteria chair, in an office decorated by someone with absolutely no taste. <i>Director Emily Piggot</i>'s office, not wearing his costume but instead a suit and tie and... was that a badge on his lapel? Why yes, yes it was.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">All in all, this was not what he would call a <i>small</i> difference.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">He felt at the badge with his left hand. It wasn't possible to tell exactly what it was without looking at it, but it seemed suspiciously similar to the one that Piggot herself was wearing, just with slightly fewer points.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Before the silence could go on too long, Thomas responded: "I'm doing fine, thank you. Great, in fact. I'm just..." he trailed off, thinking. Had he been promoted, somehow? Given an important position in the PRT? The wrong turn of phrase could give away too much, leading to his incarceration, his untimely death, or - truly the worst of them all - a prolonged stay in Master-Stranger Decontamination Facilities. (The facilities were actually rather pleasant, but there was no alcohol permitted whatsoever. He'd tested them in a single long-discarded reality and hadn't made it more than two days.)</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">A talk with someone as powerful and influential as the director, in <i>both realities</i>, had high stakes. Thankfully, Thomas had two tries at this, or so he hoped.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">In one reality, he shrugged, making a bland expression. "It's a bit difficult to adapt. I've been working on a smaller scale for so long."</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Piggot scoffed. At him! <i>How dare she?</i> "I'm sure that this will be well within your capabilities, Calvert. Now, I do need your input on this plan. I don't have the same view of this situation as you do, and your agreement here is critical. If you look at this objectively, do you believe that there's a chance of it working?"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">That seemed good enough to him, so he copied the response in the other reality, to similar results - albeit with a moderately louder scoff. Briefly, he considered telling her off (<i>Do you even know who I am?!</i>) before abandoning that idea as just a tad too risky.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm not sure I've completely understood what you're doing," he said, hoping that it would come off as more of a lack of attention than anything more sinister. "Could you summarize the general concept for me?"</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's the <i>third time</i> you've asked for a summary now, Calvert. I know I said I was confident in you, but you're actually starting to make me doubt that you're up to it."</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"It's, uh, just the wording that's getting to me," he said, hopeful.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fine." She massaged her forehead briefly. "I will <i>completely rephrase</i> the situation for you. It's really not that complicated. As you're well aware, that new cape who's turned up somewhere in the Bay has led to a complete destabilizing of the balance between gangs, with both the Empire Eighty-Eight and ABB suffering heavy losses." She stopped for a moment, tapping on the desk a few times. "Ah, and that other gang, too. The trashy ones. Forgot about them."</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>I didn't know any of that,</i> Thomas thought morosely. Was Tattletale still his minion in this reality? No, in this <i>continuity</i>? Maybe he could use one of the two universes to interrogate her about the entire situation. He'd heard it said that one shouldn't mix work with pleasure, but Coil was exceptionally good at doing so.</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">The problem was, he wasn't sure if he could afford to waste either reality. If just using his power was creating such massive changes in the city, then it was dangerous to use it too much. With only two realities active, he'd have to be exceedingly sparing with them, to avoid using up his best backup plan.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Emily picked up a pen and circled (for what appeared to be the third time, each in progressively bolder red) a location on a low-resolution printout of the Brockton Bay map. In fact, the mapping website's URL was still at the bottom of the page. Thomas refrained from asking if she had a <i>real</i> map. </p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">"This is the general vicinity of where we believe the parahuman first triggered. Anything more specific than that is, <i>obviously</i>, impossible to obtain right now, although I'm led to believe that there's a working group of thinkers who are attempting it."</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas glanced out the window for a moment, taking in the city. Across both realities, he was able to paint a somewhat clear picture of the outside, the city sprawling below the office floor. Although this particular vantage point was rather poor, due to several other tall buildings nearby, he could still see smoke rising off in the distance. </p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">Which, frankly, was probably unrelated to the situation at hand. Lung's daily barbeque was around this time, and the members of his gang had made it a rather... ritualistic event.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"Regardless, Calvert, what we do know is more than good enough. A parahuman triggered with a particularly strong master power. Specifically, as you've been briefed previously, we've observed that they can control the limbs of a group of people meeting an as-of-yet unknown criteria. We're fairly certain that their power can't affect everyone, as evidenced by the infighting between Empire Eighty-Eight members yesterday, but their restrictions appear to be completely arbitrary thus far."</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">She stopped talking, took a deep breath.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">A moment passed.</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">She covered her mouth.</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">Then her demeanour cracked, bit by bit. "I just-" she snorted- "I just ca-" a laugh, deeper this time- "can't, every time I think about Hookwolf, about that- that <i>pfft</i> chicken dance, oh," and then Thomas was watching as <i>Emily Piggot</i> broke down into full-on laughter, cradling her head in both hands.   </p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas waited patiently while she calmed down. He had to admit, he had been prepared for a lot of things, but this? <i>This</i> was truly baffling. If it was a normal day and he felt comfortable using his power, this would have been a perfect time to call Master-Stranger protocols on her. (They were a much more entertaining form of swatting, really.)</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">After what felt like an hour, the director's laughter stopped, a tear still lingering on one cheek. "My apologies. I think it's going to take some time to get over that. I'm impressed that you can keep your composure so well; half the city's had that particular video on repeat for days."</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">"Thank you," said Thomas. <i>I am indeed a rather serious sort of fellow,</i> he thought, with no small amount of pride.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"All right. In any case, humourous or not, this parahuman poses a massive threat to the power balance in Brockton Bay. If they continue this pattern of aggressively mocking and humiliating the local gangs, we might see dangerous movements from the Empire and the- ah, you know, Lung's group." She made a small motion with her hands, leaning forward. Her eyes almost seemed to peer into Thomas' soul. (They couldn't <i>actually</i> do so, that would be silly! Thomas had sold his soul for a fresh margarita years ago. It hadn't been very good; he suspected he'd been ripped off.) She continued: "Our best chance at preempting this is simple. We recruit this new parahuman ourselves."</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas frowned. It was hard to imagine. This local Protectorate hadn't successfully recruited an independent in a while, with even Shadow Stalker not being what he would term a proper 'recruitment'. He had started to doubt the PR efficacy of the infamous Armsmaster-Piggot duo some time ago - that is, around two weeks ago, when Armsmaster was caught using a hidden printer in his halberd to sign autographs. </p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">"How do you plan to find them? From what I've heard," <i>from you, barely a minute ago</i>, "there's no pattern yet as to how they're gaining this control."</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Piggot squinted at him. For a moment, Thomas was afraid he'd said the wrong thing. Fortunately, she responded anyways: "So far, they've only targeted gang members. I've consulted with Armsmaster, slightly unbalanced genius that he is, and we've come to an agreement. The only way we hope to draw out a hidden Master like this with any kind of reliability is to become a potential target - which is, as I'm sure you recall, the reason for your promotion. I didn't say this before, so I suppose I should now: congratulations, Calvert. We are truly proud to have you as our bait."</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm your- excuse me, <i>what</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">Piggot leaned forward, smiling. Thomas could see her teeth, just barely, which made him more uneasy than he would have liked to admit. "Our <i>bait</i>, Calvert, you agreed to this not even an hour ago. We're going to piece together our <i>own</i> little 'supervillain gang', make a statement, and try to entice this Master with the most delicious team you could possibly imagine."</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, I think-"</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">"That it's a great idea? I'm glad you're so on board with this, Thomas. To be honest, this is the sort of risky move that can tank a career." Piggot leaned back in her chair. "If it wasn't you, it would have to be me, so I'm honestly quite relieved that you were up for it. No need to worry too much, though. When... well, <i>if</i> it doesn't pan out, we can set you up with a cozy retirement. A small beach house, perhaps, off in an irritatingly mild climate somewhere."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">"Actually-"</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">"Anyways, moving on," she said, shuffling the papers on her desk around, "I've got another meeting in - oh, four minutes, which I rather need to prepare for. You'll be reporting to the Protectorate Headquarters tomorrow to meet with Assault, who will be leading the new pseudo-gang. You'll work with him to manage this, and who knows, if it goes well we might keep up the facade in the future. One could certainly argue its value for staying on top of the criminal element in the Bay - as long as this stays top-secret, of course. But with the levels of security we're employing, I'd be shocked if any Bay criminals could find out about this."</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">"You know, this-"</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm sure you'll be able to work well with Assault. I don't know him quite as well as Armsmaster or Miss Militia, but I'm led to believe he's a very effective leader, able to keep morale high with quick witticisms in any situation. It's really quite a shame that he'll be so busy working on this project with you, that he'll hardly have time to be active within the Protectorate itself."</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"In fact, that's-"</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm sorry, Thomas, I've given you a lot of my time to iron all of this out, and I really can't explain it to you any further. Regardless, this is out of my hands now. I'm sure you and Assault will make a great team. If you must, send me an email if you need any further clarification." She smiled. "I do check my spam folder every so often."</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas sighed and stood up. Where had all his control gone, in this continuity? Did the world no longer recognize greatness? He preferred having all the time in the world to deal with strange conversations and absurd decisions; they did seem to occur increasingly often.</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">As he turned to leave the office, a thought struck him: <i>Does any of this really matter?</i></p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">His power was - against all odds, or rather, with the very low odds he himself would have given to such a thing - altering the continuity of time itself. If activating his power again would undo everything that he'd just experienced (or even make it happen in an entirely different manner) he wouldn't have to be too concerned about what occurred. Just sit back and smell the show. Or enjoy the roses. Something like that.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">Of course, if these alterations continued to be so... <i>drastic</i>, there was no guarantee he wouldn't find himself in a much worse situation. Or perhaps he'd shunt the universe into a continuity where he was dead, potentially spiralling all of reality into a paradox-</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas stopped thinking.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">In one world, he went straight home. There was no hot meal waiting for him, but to his surprise there <i>was</i> half a pizza left over in the fridge. More than good enough, he thought, mentally thanking his past self that had never really existed.</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">In the other, and with not a small amount of trepidation, he returned to his underground base. Preliminary inspection gave no indication that anything was amiss compared to when he had, for lack of a better term, 'left' it. He still made secure calls to his three deputies before entering, fully suited up.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">"We've confirmed the rumours of the probability-based precognitive, sir," Some Grunt said. "Should we proceed with the preparation phase?"</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">"Not now," Coil responded, sitting down at his desk and relishing the feeling of a non-plastic chair. "I have someone else I need you to locate for me."</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's fine. Who is it?"</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil closed his eyes - not that the grunt could see it - and massaged his forehead. What was it that Tattletale had told him, in some universe he'd long terminated? <i>A likely trigger event at a local high school... Some place called Winslow High.</i> </p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">That was where all this insanity had started. And, if Coil's intuition was correct - which it always was, except when it wasn't - that was where it would end, also. </p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">"Bridges."</p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">"It's Britters, sir." The grunt looked somewhat miffed.</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">"Of course. I was merely testing you, Britters; your performance has been exemplary. I need you to locate a student for me. They were... a student at Winslow High, less than a month ago."</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">"Understood, sir. Is there anything else to identify them by?"</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">This was where Coil had to hedge his bets. If activating his power could shift events further back in the past than that first point - when he'd first noticed something strange happening - it would become nearly impossible to pinpoint which certainties existed across continuities. If, on the other hand, he had accurately pinpointed the beginning, he could reliably come to an understanding of what was happening by simply examining the differences since that point. </p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">His mind overheating from thinking so hard, it took another few seconds to dredge up the faint memories of the details Tattletale had given him. "They were possibly bullied, maybe dropped out by now - but I'll let you figure that out. They're an ostracized student. One with <i>powers</i>."</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph">The magic word. Britters nodded, and Coil could almost see the gears turning in the brain of his chief 'investigator', or whatever he did, Coil couldn't be bothered to remember.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">"And, Britters?"</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes, sir?"</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">He would have to keep his two worlds alive as long as possible, and gather whatever information he could get his hands on. There was no way to predict what would happen, the next time he activated his power. If the universe continued to shift under his feet, the only thing he'd be able to take with him was his knowledge.</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">"Don't take any unnecessary risks. <i>I only need a name.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes, sir."</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-03.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-05.html">Next</a></b></p>

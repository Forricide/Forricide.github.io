<p>"Calvert. Hello, Calvert? Look at me." His vision swam, eyes adjusting to the sudden fluorescent lighting. "Thomas? Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Wh-oh, ah, Director Piggot." He adjusted his glasses. "I, uh, apologize for my lack of attentiveness."</p>

<p>The head of the local PRT gave him a strange look. "Are you feeling well, Thomas? You haven't really been up to your normal speed this entire day."</p>

<p>All day. Right. What just happened? He had split timelines, ostensibly to investigate the possibility of his power causing small but observable changes in continuity between uses. At the same moment, he'd somehow moved to a different location - several miles away, in fact - and ended up, within both timelines, in this office. <i>Director Emily Piggot</i>'s office, wearing a suit and tie and... was that a badge on his lapel? Why yes, yes it was.</p>

<p>All in all, this was not what he would call a <i>small</i> difference.</p>

<p>He idly felt at the badge with his left hand. It wasn't possible to tell exactly what it was without looking at it, but it seemed suspiciously similar to the one that Piggot herself was wearing, just with slightly fewer points.</p>

<p>"I'm doing fine, thank you. Great, in fact. I'm just..." Thomas thought fast. Had he been promoted, somehow? Given an important position in the PRT? The wrong turn of phrase could give away too much, leading to his incarceration, death, or - the worst of them all - a prolonged stay in Master-Stranger Contamination Facilities. (The facilities were actually rather nice, but there was no alcohol permitted whatsoever.)</p>

<p>Thankfully, Thomas had two tries at this, or so he hoped.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he shrugged. "It's a bit difficult to adapt. I've been working on a smaller scale for so long."</p>

<p>Piggot scoffed. At him! <i>How dare she?</i> "I'm sure that this will be well within your capabilities, Calvert. Now, I do need your input on this plan. I don't have the same view of this situation as you do. Do you believe that there's a chance of this working?"</p>

<p>That seemed good enough to him, so he copied the response in the other timeline, to similar results (albeit with a moderately louder scoff).</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I've completely understood what you're doing," he said, hoping that it would come off as more of a lack of attention than anything more sinister. "Could you summarize the general concept for me?"</p>

<p>"That's the <i>third time</i> you've asked for a summary now, Calvert. I know I said I was confident in you, but you're actually starting to make me doubt that you're up to it."</p>

<p>"It's, uh, just the wording that's getting to me," he said, hopeful.</p>

<p>"Fine. I will <i>completely rephrase</i> the summary for you. It's really not that complicated. As you're well aware, a recent parahuman trigger in the Bay has led to a complete destabilizing of the balance between gangs, with both the Empire Eighty-Eight and ABB suffering heavy losses." She stopped for a moment, tapping on the desk a few times. "Ah, and the Merchants, too. Easy to forget about them."</p>

<p><i>I didn't know any of that,</i> Thomas thought morosely. Was Tattletale still his minion in this timeline? No, this <i>continuity</i>? Maybe he could use a timeline to interrogate her about the entire situation. He'd heard it said that one shouldn't mix work with pleasure, but Coil was exceptionally good at doing so.</p>

<p>The problem was, he wasn't sure if he could afford to waste timelines. If just using his power was creating such massive changes in the city, then it was dangerous to use too much. With only two timelines active, he'd have to be exceedingly sparing with them, to avoid using up his best backup plan.</p>

<p>Emily picked up a pen and circled (for what appeared to be the third time) a location on a low-resolution printout of the Brockton Bay map. "This is the general vicinity of where we believe the parahuman first triggered. Anything more specific than that is, <i>obviously</i>, impossible to obtain right now, although I'm led to believe that there's a working group of thinkers who are attempting it."</p>

<p>As the director took a moment to rearrange the papers on her desk, Thomas looked out the window. The vantage point was rather poor, yet he could still see smoke rising from distant buildings. </p>

<p>"Regardless, what we do know is more than good enough. A parahuman triggered with a particularly strong master power. What we've observed is that they can control the limbs of people meeting some as-of-yet unknown criteria. They can't control everyone, as evidenced by the infighting between Empire Eighty-Eight members yesterday, but their restrictions appear to be completely arbitrary thus far."</p>

<p>She stopped talking. Then her demeanour cracked, bit by bit. "I just-" she snorted- "I just ca-" a laugh, deeper this time- "can't, every time I think about that, the <i>pfft</i> chicken dance, oh," and then Thomas was watching as <i>Emily Piggot</i> broke down into full-on laughter, cradling her head in both hands.</p>

<p>Thomas waited patiently while she calmed down. He had to admit, he had been prepared for a lot of things, but this? <i>This</i> was truly baffling.</p>

<p>After what felt like an hour, the director's laughter stopped, a tear still lingering on one cheek. "My apologies. I think it's going to take some time to get over that. I'm surprised you can keep your composure so well."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Thomas. He was indeed a rather serious sort of fellow.</p>

<p>"All right. In any case, humourous or not, this parahuman is a massive danger to the power balance in Brockton Bay. If they continue this pattern of aggressively mocking the local gangs, we might see dangerous movements from the Empire and the- ah, Lung's group." She made a small motion with her hands, as her eyes almost seemed to peer into Thomas' soul. (They couldn't <i>actually</i> do so, that would be silly! Thomas had sold his soul for a fresh margarita years ago. It hadn't been very good. He suspected he'd been ripped off.) "Our best chance at preempting this is simple: we recruit this new parahuman ourselves."</p>

<p>Thomas frowned. It was hard to imagine. This local Protectorate hadn't successfully recruited an independent in a while, with even Shadow Stalker not being what he would term a proper 'recruitment'. He had started to doubt the PR efficacy of the infamous Armsmaster-Piggot duo some time ago. "How do you plan to find them? From what I've heard," <i>from you, four minutes ago</i>, "there's no pattern yet as to how they're gaining this control."</p>

<p>"So far, they've only targeted gang members. I've consulted with Armsmaster, genius that he is, and we've come to an agreement. The only way we hope to draw out a hidden Master like this with any kind of reliability is to become a potential target - which is, as I'm sure you recall, the reason for your promotion. Congratulations, Calvert. We're proud to have you as our bait."</p>

<p>"I'm your- sorry, <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>Piggot leaned forward, smiling. Thomas could see her teeth, just barely, which made him more uneasy than he would have liked to admit. "Our <i>bait</i>, Calvert. We're going to piece together our <i>own</i> little 'supervillain gang', make a statement, and try to entice this Master with the most delicious team you could possibly imagine."</p>

<p>"Well, I think-"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're so on board with this, Thomas. To be honest, this is the sort of risky move that can tank a career." Piggot leaned back in her chair. "If it wasn't you, it would have to be me, so I'm a bit relieved that you were up for it. No need to worry too much, though. If it doesn't pan out, we can set you up with a cozy retirement. A small beach house, perhaps, off in an irritatingly mild climate somewhere."</p>

<p>"Actually-"</p>

<p>"Anyways, moving on," she said, shuffling the papers on her desk around, "I've got another meeting in - oh, four minutes, which I rather need to prepare for. I'll need you to report to the Protectorate Headquarters tomorrow to meet with Assault, who'll be leading the new pseudo-gang. You'll work with him to manage this, and who knows, if it goes well we might keep up the facade in the future. It might be valuable to keep on top of the criminal element in the Bay."</p>

<p>"You know, this-"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll be able to work well with Assault. I don't know him quite as well as Armsmaster or Miss Militia, but I'm led to believe he's an effective leader, able to keep morale high in any situation. It's really quite a shame that he'll be so busy working on this project with you, that he'll hardly have time to be active within the Protectorate itself."</p>

<p>"In fact, that's-"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Thomas, I've given you a lot of my time for this, and I really can't explain it to you any further. Regardless, this is out of my hands now. I'm sure you and Assault will make a great team. If you must, send me an email if you need any further clarification." She smiled. "I do check my spam folder every so often."</p>

<p>Thomas sighed and stood up. He missed being in contol, where a great man like him belonged. He preferred having all the time in the world to deal with strange conversations and absurd decisions.</p>

<p><i>Does any of this really matter?</i></p>

<p>His power was - against all odds, or rather, specifically the low odds he himself would have given to such a thing - altering the continuity of time itself. If activating his power again would undo everything that he'd just experienced - or make it happen in an entirely different manner - he wouldn't have to be too concerned about what occurred. Just sit back and smell the show. Or enjoy the roses. Something like that.</p>

<p>In one timeline, he went straight home. There was no hot meal waiting for him, but to his surprise there <i>was</i> half a pizza left over in the fridge. More than good enough, he thought, mentally thanking his past self that had never really existed.</p>

<p>In the other, and with not a small amount of trepidation, he returned to his underground base. Preliminary inspection gave no indication that anything was amiss compared to when he had, for lack of a better term, 'left' it. He still made secure calls to his three deputies before entering, fully suited up.</p>

<p>"We've confirmed the rumours of the probability-based precognitive, sir," Some Grunt said.</p>

<p>"Not now," Coil responded, sitting down at his desk and relishing the feeling of a non-plastic chair. "I have someone else I need you to locate for me."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Who is it?"</p>

<p>Coil closed his eyes - not that the grunt could see it - and massaged his forehead. What was it that Tattletale had told him, several timelines ago? <i>A trigger event at a local high school... Some place called Winslow High.</i></p>

<p>That was where all this insanity had started. And, if Coil's intuition was correct, that was where it would end, also.</p>

<p>"Bridges."</p>

<p>"It's Britters, sir." The grunt looked somewhat miffed.</p>

<p>"Of course. I was merely testing you, Britters. I need you to locate a student for me. They were... a student at Winslow High, less than a month ago."</p>

<p>"Understood, sir. Is there anything else to identify them by?"</p>

<p>This was where Coil had to hedge his bets. If activating his power could shift events further back in the past than that first point - when he'd first noticed something strange happening - it would become nearly impossible to pinpoint what certainties existed across timelines. If, on the other hand, he had accurately pinpointed the beginning, he could reliably come to an understanding of what was happening by just examining the differences since that point. "They were possibly bullied, maybe dropped out by now - but I'll let you figure that out. They're an ostracized student. One with <i>powers</i>."</p>

<p>The magic word. Britters nodded, and Coil could almost see the gears turning in the brain of his chief 'investigator'.</p>

<p>"And, Britters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>He would keep his two timelines alive as long as he could. There was no way to predict what would happen, the next time he activated his power.</p>

<p>"Don't take any unnecessary risks. <i>I only need a name.</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Dying simultaneously in thirteen different realities was a pleasure Coil had never expected to undergo. And yet, here he was - yet again down to a single reality, more than a little shell shocked.</p>

<p>Lung grunted. "Thirteen down. <i>Spades</i>."</p>

<p>Coil obligingly filled out the squares. In pencil, of course; he only used pen for his own answers.</p>

<p>It was, he mused, not entirely surprising that a bomb tinker would have planted bombs in a few locations. An abandoned endbringer shelter, like the one he'd converted into an impenetrable secret base, may have seemed a good target.</p>

<p>Or Lung had given his gang information on where to find Coil. Always a possibility. You really couldn't trust anyone in this city, after all.</p>

<p>There really was nothing for it. A part of him wanted to give up; to just stop using his power at all, and retire in a less gang-riddled city. Maybe he could get a job, even.</p>

<p>Coil briefly considered spending the rest of his life sitting at a desk, working a 9-5, and coming home to spend what little time he had on his hobbies - writing, or winning at online poker.</p>

<p>Before he could fully process the deep feeling of unease that surged up at the thought, Lung said: "You're distracted. Fifty across. <i>Verisimilitude</i>."</p>

<p>Coil picked up the pencil, paused, let one last image of blue collar work flash through his mind, and then cleaved reality like he never had before (or, he would have, if there was anything vaguely resembling style to the way he activated his power, which there was not).</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Nazis were, Coil decided, quite inscrutable.</p>

<p><i>"Krieg. How is the tinker acquisition progressing?"</i></p>

<p>This had little to do with the current conversation he was privy to, broadcast securely from his hidden cameras. No, although he had been listening in to the Empire Eighty-Eight's meetings for quite some time, the scrutability of nazis had remained terminally low.</p>

<p><i>"I have contacted Geschellschaft, but they have yet to respond,"</i> said Krieg, in a shockingly subtle German accent.</p>

<p>That was a part of what Coil did not understand. If Germany was really that great, then why didn't the Nazis speak German? It provided a tactical advantage, after all. In fact, Coil had made up an entire language once, designed to allow private communications. It had worked perfectly: Nobody could understand him. He had, of course, never used it again.</p>

<p><i>"I wasn't referring to the Gisselleshafft tinker. That seems to be a dead end."</i> On Coil's laptop screen, Kaiser leaned forward, coupling his hands in what would normally be an innocuous manner, but seemed vaguely menacing coming from a violent neo-nazi. <i>"I'm more interested in the local one - the 'hero' at that bank robbery the other day."</i></p>

<p>Of course, it wasn't like Coil particularly felt a desire to understand nazis. There were no gangs in his vision for the future of Brockton Bay, and that would likely require the full removal of its superhuman nazi infestation. (Of course, Coil's own gang would become the government.)</p>

<p><i>"Hm, I am not sure we are speaking of the same tinker. You are aware that Geshelcraft's tinker was capable of creating solar energy-based weapons, yes? They gave me the impression that they were the finest Streuselshaft had to offer."</i></p>

<p>They were also, of course, hardly comprehensible in this particular conversation. That may have been due to Coil's penchant for going off on mental tangents while others were speaking. In fairness, even the most fleeting thought of Coil's was several orders of magnitude more valuable than the full contents of any conversation an Empire Eighty-Eight member might have.</p>

<p><i>"Yes, this is true. However, if Geschellshaft has been nonresponsive for the past two weeks... they may be undergoing some organisational difficulties. This is why the local tinker is appealing; they should be far easier to acquire, and don't increase our reliance on Gesundheitschaft."</i></p>

<p>Coil spent a moment studying Kaiser's facial expression. This was difficult, as he couldn't actually see the man's face, due to the mask of metal he wore. Instead, Coil had to guess what Kaiser's face looked like - whatever the case, he imagined it wasn't particularly intelligent.</p>

<p><i>"Gisselshafft is more than capable of pulling through,"</i> Krieg said. <i>"But, to get to the point; no, we have given up on recruiting the new tinker. A preliminary investigation revealed that they would not be worth the effort."</i></p>

<p>There was a poignant pause in the room. Coil ate a strawberry.</p>

<p><i>"A tinker not worth the effort? And why, pray tell, would that be, Krieg? Don't tell me it's because it would distract us from your Geseilleshaft connections."</i></p>

<p><i>"I had our men look into her. She's an ice tinker, Kaiser. Also, did you just pronounce Gesellschaft wrong?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Nevermind the pronunciation. I don't see what being an ice tinker has to do with anything."</i></p>

<p><i>"This is Brockton Bay,"</i> Krieg said, <i>"everything she makes just melts. It's literally useless."</i></p>

<p><i>"I find that hard to believe. Wasn't she fighting that heist gang the other day? What did she do there?"</i></p>

<p><i>"When she went to stop the bank robbery, she tried to use a snow cannon to block off the Undersiders' escape. The snow melted before it even touched the concrete, and Aegis slipped on a puddle."</i></p>

<p><i>"They could still be useful," Kaiser said. "Perhaps Rune could fly around, and they could... snow on people."</i></p>

<p>Krieg sighed.</p>

<p><i>"They're a</i> puddle tinker. <i>We'd be the laughing stock of the city. No. I will not work on this. I absolutely refuse it."</i></p>

<p>Finally, Kaiser nodded his head. <i>"Very well. We'll just have to hope the Gesundheitshaft respond sooner than later. A tinker would greatly assist in our control of the city."</i></p>

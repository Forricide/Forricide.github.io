<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">Dying simultaneously in fourteen different realities was a pleasure Coil had never expected to undergo. And yet, here he was - yet again down to a single reality, more than a little shell shocked.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung grunted. "Thirteen down. <i>Spades</i>." </p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil obligingly filled out the squares. In pencil, of course; he only used pen for his own answers.</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">It was, he mused, not entirely surprising that a bomb tinker would have planted bombs in a few locations. An abandoned endbringer shelter, like the one he'd converted into an impenetrable secret base, may have seemed a good target.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">Or Lung had given his gang information on where to find Coil. Always a possibility. You really couldn't trust anyone in this city, after all.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">There really was nothing for it. A part of him wanted to give up; to just stop using his power at all, and retire in a less gang-riddled city. Maybe he could get a job, even.</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil briefly considered spending the rest of his life sitting at a desk, working a 9-5, and coming home to spend what little time he had on his hobbies - writing, or winning at online poker.   </p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">Before he could fully process the deep feeling of unease that surged up at the thought, Lung said: "You're distracted. Fifty across. <i>Verisimilitude</i>."</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil picked up the pencil, paused, let one last image of blue collar work flash through his mind, and then cleaved reality like he never had before (or, he would have, if there was anything vaguely resembling style to the way he activated his power, which there was not).</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">  </p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">Nazis were, Coil decided, quite inscrutable.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Krieg. How is the tinker acquisition progressing?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">This had little to do with the current conversation he was privy to, broadcast securely from his hidden cameras. No, although he had been listening in to the Empire Eighty-Eight's meetings for quite some time, the scrutability of nazis had remained terminally low.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I have contacted Geschellschaft, but they have yet to respond,"</i> said Krieg, in a shockingly subtle German accent.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">That was a part of what Coil did not understand. If Germany was really that great, then why didn't the Nazis speak German? It provided a tactical advantage, after all. In fact, Coil had made up an entire language once, designed to allow private communications. It had worked perfectly: Nobody could understand him. He had, of course, never used it again.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I wasn't referring to the Gesselleshafft tinker. That seems to be a dead end."</i> On Coil's laptop screen, Kaiser leaned forward, coupling his hands in what would normally be an innocuous manner, but seemed vaguely menacing coming from a violent neo-nazi. <i>"I'm more interested in the local one - the 'hero' at that bank robbery the other day."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Of course, it wasn't like Coil particularly felt a desire to understand nazis. There were no gangs in his vision for the future of Brockton Bay, and that would likely require the full removal of its superhuman nazi infestation. (Of course, Coil's own gang would become the government.)</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Hm, I am not sure we are speaking of the same tinker. You are aware that Geshelcraft's tinker was capable of creating solar energy-based weapons, yes? They gave me the impression that they were the finest Streuselshaft had to offer."</i> </p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">They were also, of course, hardly comprehensible in this particular conversation. That may have been due to Coil's penchant for going off on mental tangents while others were speaking. In fairness, even the most fleeting thought of Coil's was several orders of magnitude more valuable than the full contents of any conversation an Empire Eighty-Eight member might have.</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Yes, this is true. However, if Geschellshaft has been nonresponsive for the past two weeks... they may be undergoing some organisational difficulties. This is why the local tinker is appealing; they should be far easier to acquire, and don't increase our reliance on Gesundheitschaft."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil spent a moment studying Kaiser's facial expression. This was difficult, as he couldn't actually see the man's face, due to the mask of metal he wore. Instead, Coil had to guess what Kaiser's face looked like - whatever the case, he imagined it wasn't particularly intelligent.</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Gisselshafft is more than capable of pulling through,"</i> Krieg said. <i>"But, to get to the point; no, we have given up on recruiting the new tinker. A preliminary investigation revealed that they would not be worth the effort."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">There was a poignant pause in the room. Coil ate a strawberry.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"A tinker not worth the effort? And why, pray tell, would that be, Krieg? Don't tell me it's because it would distract us from your Geseilleshaft connections."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I had our men look into her. She's an ice tinker, Kaiser. Also, did you just pronounce Gesellschaft wrong?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Nevermind the pronunciation. I don't see what being an ice tinker has to do with anything."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"This is Brockton Bay,"</i> Krieg said, <i>"everything she makes just melts. It's literally useless."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I find that hard to believe. Wasn't she fighting that heist gang the other day? What did she do there?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"When she went to stop the bank robbery, she tried to use a snow cannon to block off the Undersiders' escape. The snow melted before it even touched the concrete, and Aegis slipped on a puddle."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"They could still be useful," Kaiser said. "Perhaps Rune could fly around, and they could... I don't know,</i> snow <i>on people."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">Krieg sighed.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"They're a</i> puddle tinker. <i>We'd be the laughing stock of the city. No. I will not work on this. I absolutely refuse it."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">Finally, Kaiser nodded his head. <i>"Very well. We'll just have to hope the Gesundheitshaft respond sooner than later. A tinker would greatly assist in our control of the city."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">Satisfied that he'd gleaned all the information there was to be had, Coil shut off the video feed.</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">Of course, most of this he already knew. He'd spent the last <i>three hours</i> going through the notes and documentation of his previous self this time, and discovered something strange. That being said, in his opinion the majority of the events he'd experienced recently were quite odd, so something being strange was actually - in at least the statistical sense of the word - normal.</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">He had clear information that the 'ice tinker' (who was indeed, according to his own notes, <i>'hilariously useless at room temperature'</i>) was a teenage girl - specifically, one <i>Taylor Hebert</i>, a Brockton Bay native.</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">The tinker's debut had actually been rather impressive: she'd fought Lung with a snowblower, saving the Undersiders from the consequences of their actions. She'd refused Tattletale's attempt to recruit her - apparently her personality was 'somewhat cold' - and shown up to the Undersiders' bank robbery. As Krieg had noted, she'd ended up helping the Undersiders there, too.</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">It was, in Coil's opinion, quite the shame she'd ended up in a coma after trying to fight Bakuda. Of course, the several thousand deaths (and many more mutilations) were also a bit unfortunate, but most of those people had not had powers, and therefore were - as the reader will surely agree - irrelevant.</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">In his other reality, Coil had attempted to have her healed by Panacea. Although he'd heard it reported (several times) that the city's replacement for free healthcare didn't 'do' brains, he had figured a bit of money could solve that problem. It was truly incredible what you could get people to do for money - donate their organs to you, betray their families, play poker with a thinker...</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">Unfortunately, the list apparently didn't include curing comas, which was why he was now very much under arrest in that reality.</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">"Coil, you are now under arrest," said Miss Militia. A tad redundant, but Coil supposed she wasn't quite savvy enough to read his internal monologue.</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">Fortunately, Coil had just the trick for this. "In fact, that is not the case, madame." He shuffled his hands, already a bit sore in cuffs. Approaching Panacea in costume at the hospital might not have been the brightest idea; in retrospect, he should have been slightly less drunk. "As a free person of America, I do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Primary Retainers of Taxation (hereafter referred to as the 'PRT') or the local paramilitary organization formally named as the Protectorate. As such, this detainment is in fact inapplicable, and you must let me go lest I employ my freedoms as an American citizen and sue you so deep into oblivion that the grandchildren of current taxpayers will still be paying off the debt."</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">  </p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">As a staunch protector of American rights and freedoms, Miss Militia would surely cede the point and let him go.</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">"...you have the right to remain silent," she continued, giving a signal to one of the PRT officers standing behind her.</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well. In fact, <i>you</i> have the right to remain silent, because I am placing <i>you</i> under arrest," Coil said. "The US constitution notes that human citizens of the country have the right to bear arms. As you are a <i>para</i>human, you do not, in fact, have the right to carry your firearm, and must immediately cede it to me. And do it quickly, taxpayer foeti are begging you." </p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">The officer began to jostle Coil towards the exit. It seemed Miss Militia had decided to exercise her rights; she wasn't saying anything. This may have been a slight miscalculation; fortunately, he had an ace up his sleeve.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">"I must insist you answer whether or not I am being detained."   </p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">They did not.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">As he was awkwardly shuffled into a PRT van, Coil sighed and mentally crossed off another three tips from <i>Seven Things Law Enforcement Doesn't Want You To Know</i>, an apparently <i>very</i> inaccurate article he'd once stumbled upon. He was starting to think finding good strategies for criminal activity on the internet wasn't that easy.</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">Chafing restraints might have bothered a less stoic individual, but Coil merely had to perform his sacred technique of <i>mind melding</i> and let the feelings of his other body subsume him.</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">Those feelings were mostly frustration. Even as he leaned back in one reality, slowly making his way through a fine vintage his past self had blessedly left behind, and slowly settled into position in the other, PRT transport van motoring along... he found himself drawn into a certain kind of thought, trapped yet again in the same cyclic headspace he'd been struggling with.</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">How was he supposed to make any progress if using his power led to -- <i>this?</i> </p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">He hadn't even been able to write in <i>days</i>. What was the point, if it was just going to be erased the next time he used his power anyways?</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">Practice?</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">Hah, he was already perfect.</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">No, he had to stop settling for these mediocre continuities. Before, he had been afraid of the unknown, but now Coil knew the truth: He had to <i>embrace</i> it. Embrace that fear, dive into the unknown, and commit to each continuity. Throw his full effort into it, discover whether or not it was viable, and move on if not.</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">This didn't follow his older plans, but he <i>couldn't</i> follow them anymore. He had to make new plans, adapt.</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil closed the reality where he was still at his desk, his office disappearing from his mind's eye.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">He waited in the PRT transport van for a few minutes. Felt at the chafing restraints, took in the officers watching him.</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">Truly alone. Trapped.</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">He savoured that feeling, played with it, and knew that it had no effect.</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">  </p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil activated his powers, and he was free.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-11.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-13.html">Next</a></b></p>

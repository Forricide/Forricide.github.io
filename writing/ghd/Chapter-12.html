<p>Dying simultaneously in thirteen different realities was a pleasure Coil had never expected to undergo. And yet, here he was - yet again down to a single reality, more than a little shell shocked.</p>

<p>Lung grunted. "Thirteen down. <i>Spades</i>."</p>

<p>Coil obligingly filled out the squares. In pencil, of course; he only used pen for his own answers.</p>

<p>It was, he mused, not entirely surprising that a bomb tinker would have planted bombs in a few locations. An abandoned endbringer shelter, like the one he'd converted into an impenetrable secret base, may have seemed a good target.</p>

<p>Or Lung had given his gang information on where to find Coil. Always a possibility. You really couldn't trust anyone in this city, after all.</p>

<p>There really was nothing for it. A part of him wanted to give up; to just stop using his power at all, and retire in a less gang-riddled city. Maybe he could get a job, even.</p>

<p>Coil briefly considered spending the rest of his life sitting at a desk, working a 9-5, and coming home to spend what little time he had on his hobbies - writing, or winning at online poker.</p>

<p>Before he could fully process the deep feeling of unease that surged up at the thought, Lung said: "You're distracted. Fifty across. <i>Verisimilitude</i>."</p>

<p>Coil picked up the pencil, paused, let one last image of blue collar work flash through his mind, and then cleaved reality like he never had before (or, he would have, if there was anything vaguely resembling style to the way he activated his power, which there was not).</p>

<p>A small sound alerted Thomas to a new text.</p>

<p><i>at bank. start?</i></p>

<p>In that reality, he responded: <i>go now</i></p>

<p>In the other, he had to wait two more minutes to receive the text from Assault. He couldn't fathom why. Regardless, that worked well with what he was planning. If he only had two realities, he had to make them count; he was going to make full use of running asynchronous operations within each to gain information that he could use within the other.</p>

<p>He didn't reply to the second text, waiting as he placed a call in the first reality. If all was going well, Assault and his... well, Coil couldn't quite think of them as a <i>gang</i>, but regardless - Assault and his gang would be moving into the bank in his first reality, ready to create his masterful distraction. In the second reality, they'd be waiting in the wings; an unwitting backup plan.</p>

<p><i>"Sir,"</i> came a calm, vaguely British voice over the phone.</p>

<p>"MacArthur. What is the status of the bank robbery?"</p>

<p><i>"There's a strange cape in a suit holding up the bank with a hunting rifle. I'm not sure how long he'll manage to keep anyone from running. He looks a bit ridiculous,"</i> the man said. The mercenary had never once questioned why he had been sent to stake out the bank, or how Coil had known there would be a robbery. Coil loved professionals. He sorely missed this kind of competence in his day job. <i>"Otherwise, the police department has a few cars outside, but they're staying well back. The PRT isn't here yet, but I've spotted a lot of bystanders with phones, so it's only a matter of time."</i></p>

<p>In other words: Everything was proceeding smoothly. Thomas grinned. "Perfect. I will call you again in ten minutes."</p>

<p><i>stay in the van for now, and wait for my command</i>, he texted back to Assault in the second reality.</p>

<p>He leaned back in an office chair, smiling. Ten minutes ago, he'd successfully taken his revenge on human resources by commandeering one of the nicest offices in the PRT headquarters using a little-known SQL injection exploit in the scheduling system. He suspected this might lead to IT finally figuring it out, but it was well worth it to see the face of one of human resources' grunts as he showed them his room booking.</p>

<p>In order to optimize his chances of success, Coil had kept his overall plan (relatively) simple. In his first universe, he'd allow both the kidnapping and the bank robbery to progress as intended. He had already made sure that one of his henchmen had phoned in the robbery, and one of his moles in the PRT had reported by text that the Wards, sans Aegis, had been deployed. That left exactly zero superheroes in the city that were capable of responding to the simultaneous kidnapping. <i>Well, except for New Wave.</i> Thankfully, he was confident that they couldn't beat a cornered single parent, let alone a team of trained mercenaries.</p>

<p>While he was coordinating with Assault in that reality, Coil would keep the robbery from starting in the other; by staggering the start time, he was sure to have forewarning of any potential problems that might arise in the first. Even with his power crippled as it was, he would stay in control.</p>

<p>This was an incredibly clever application of his limited resources, and Coil's only regret was that he had nobody to gloat to.</p>

<p>In the second reality, his phone rang.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>If Assault was being honest with himself - and why would he lie? - he wouldn't have called himself a particularly <i>patient</i> person. </p>

<p>Oh, sure, he could wait for things. He'd practised it before, several times. His personal record sat at one and a half minutes; to anyone who knew him, this was rather impressive. (And, really, completely innaccurate; he'd fallen asleep at the halfway point)</p>

<p>The truth was, waiting was just not that fun. Especially when there was something important to do, like eating a mostly-warm burrito, subtly lobbying against the birdcage, watching a television show, or robbing a bank. Assault was a busy man; he didn't have time to wait in a van for a go-ahead.</p>

<p>He sighed, fiddling with his phone. How long had it been since he sent the text? </p>

<p>Ah, twenty seconds ago.</p>

<p>Assault took a deep breath and started counting to one-hundred.</p>

<p>He didn't make it to fifty.</p>

<p>"Well, the door's locked," Velocity said, crossing his arms while still awkwardly holding the rifle. The four of them stood awkwardly around the back door to the bank, an emergency exit protected by a heavy-duty keypad lock. "Guess that puts our little heist on hold. Come back tomorrow, eh, guys?"</p>

<p>Assault gestured to Dauntless, who shrugged and stepped forward. "I'm still not sure about this entire plan."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, buddy," Assault said. "What could go wrong? What, worse case scenario is we're fired from our jobs, end up in prison, and lose any chance at finding any success in our lives... slowly becoming husks of our old selves, we spend our last days waiting for the sweet release of death, hoping that our estranged families will at least mourn our passing."</p>

<p>Dauntless stared at him.</p>

<p>"It's a joke! You need to lighten up, bud. C'mon, just take out the door, we don't have all day. Wouldn't want to disappoint Piggot, would we?"</p>

<p>Assault took a step back, and watched as Dauntless finally broke down the door, metal screeching as he rent it with - well, it <i>used to be</i> his Arclance, but their extrajudicial PR team had somehow managed to get it wrapped up as some kind of glowing sword.  </p>

<p>Speaking of which, he had to admire the job PR had done with the rest of the team. He wasn't sure where Calvert had found five ex-military people with this kind of skill in design and disguise, but he certainly couldn't complain. </p>

<p>Dauntless had been re-outfitted as a knight, complete with chainmail and a shield. The helmet made him look much taller than anyone else, especially Aegis, who'd been rebranded as a mummy; Assault figured the kid was nervous, because he hadn't said anything since his mouth had been covered with tape. Meanwhile, Velocity had a cowboy outfit to go along with his <i>superpower</i> (specifically, the gun he'd christened 'superpower'), and Assault himself was decked out as a human target dummy, complete with a massive ring target drawn on his back. It was <i>incredibly</i> thoughtful of Calvert, or the PR team; basically an assurance he'd be getting all the kinetic charge he needed to fight.</p>

<p>Not that he expected to be fighting, of course. No, no. Only hit and run.</p>

<p><i>Only hit and run</i>, he told himself.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>"There's a <i>what?!</i>"</p>

<p><i>"The bank robbery, sir,"</i> MacArthur replied, apparently unruffled. <i>"My apologies if you wanted me to wait for your call, but I'm not sure I'll be able to actually</i> use <i>my phone shortly."</i></p>

<p>Coil rubbed his forehead, groaning. Had another group somehow simultaneously decided to rob the bank at the same time? Had he accidentally told the Undersiders to do it, and forgotten?</p>

<p>No, that couldn't be. He hadn't contacted Tattletale for the duration he'd been in this continuity; he'd deemed it not worth the time investment, considering he couldn't use his powers to get any kind of actionable information out of her.</p>

<p>For a moment, he considered the possibility that he'd lost track of reality - literally - and this was the world where he'd given Assault the go-ahead. He even double-checked in the other world, opening up a short video his mercenary had taken for him.</p>

<p>Nope, that was indeed Velocity.</p>

<p>"Give me the details, MacArthur. Who's robbing the bank?"</p>

<p><i>"Seems to be some weird cape in a cowboy getup, holding a rifle. Stick thin, a little jumpy. He had friends with him, but they disappeared in the back."</i></p>

<p>Coil resisted the urge to crush his phone, melt down the metal inside, turn it into a bullet and use it as ammunition in a sniper rifle to kill Assault. It probably wouldn't even work.</p>

<p>"Okay. Tell me if any heroes show up."</p>

<p><i>"I will contact you immediately, if possible."</i></p>

<p>"That will have to do," Coil said.</p>

<p>He ended the call, and entered another number.</p>

<p><i>"Rosina spe-"</i></p>

<p>"It's me. Go now, get the child, and get out."</p>

<p><i>"...Understood, sir."</i></p>

<p>Thomas didn't wait for the mercenary to hang up.</p>

<p>He considered going through the <i>six hundred</i> notifications he'd been putting off on his phone, but he needed to focus on the mission.</p>

<p><i>Take deep breaths, Calvert, things will be fine</i>, he told himself in the voice of the grade eight gym teacher he'd later had framed for grand larceny.</p>

<p>Really, everything <i>should</i> have been fine. The Protectorate capes were busy with <i>something</i>, the Wards were apparently en route to the bank in both timelines - there was no way Assault's pseudo-gang would lose, so by the end of the day he'd almost certainly have success in both his official and cape roles.</p>

<p>He was even considering abandoning his cape identity altogether. He'd been forming a plan to do so for a long time, and the acquisition of that child precog today would be pivotal in enabling it.</p>

<p>Thomas finally took a breath.</p>

<p><i>Everything's going to be fine.</i></p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Ten minutes after breaking into the bank, laughing maniacally while holding Kid Win's destroyed hoverboard above his head, Assault couldn't help but wonder: <i>Where did it all go wrong?</i></p>

<p>It was probably when he dropped the French accent.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>"Calvert. Report."</p>

<p>Normally, Thomas would be the paragon of calm stillness, as the cat posters in his office encouraged. Here and now, however irrationally, he felt like squirming in his seat. Why was this office so hot? <i>It's like the PRT doesn't have a budget for air conditioning.</i> "This morning, I executed the first phase of our multi-stage city enrichment plan. I utilized -"</p>

<p>"Plain English, Calvert," Emily Piggot said. Her expression was completely flat, and Thomas (not for the first time) desperately wished he could simply exercise his power and use a reality (or three) to get answers out of her.</p>

<p>His mercenaries had reported successfully capturing the child precognitive. Coil hadn't heard from them since, but he supposed they'd most likely just ran into traffic.</p>

<p>With his plans executed flawlessly in both realities, he was finding it harder and harder to think of using his power again, and simply achieving his long-term goals with the two slightly-desynchronized universes he did have access to. But, that hinged on him somehow still managing to take a higher position in his civilian life. Considering his plans for the precog... well, it wouldn't do to not have total control, after all.</p>

<p>There was no other choice. He had to sell this.</p>

<p>"I had the team rob a bank, and beat up the Wards, and it was all caught on camera," he said. </p>

<p>Piggot frowned.</p>

<p>"It was, in my professional estimation," Thomas said, "a complete success. The gang was made known in a <i>very</i> public way, and acquired quite the reputation in the span of a day. Chances are, they'll be targeted by this master within a matter of weeks."</p>

<p>Piggot frowned deeper, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Although we may have caused some minor embarrassments for the Wards, the PR hit will be easily recouped when we have the Protectorate take down and 'disband' the gang."</p>

<p>Piggot's frown achieved previously unheard of proportions.</p>

<p>"In fact, the Wards showing up is ideal, because their - quite frankly, depressingly easy - defeat raises the likelihood that this master will find the 'gang' to be an acceptable target."</p>

<p>In a tent city somewhere in the wreckage of Japan, a true artist began to write a poem about the magnificent circumference of Piggot's frown.</p>

<p>"So, I think you'll find that today was, really, a complete success." Thomas paused. "And, ah, include that on your report."</p>

<p>Thomas' brain suddenly suffered from a case of extreme semantic satiation with respect to the word <i>frown</i>, and so Piggot's expression ceased to hold meaning in his mind.</p>

<p>For quite a long time, nobody said anything. </p>

<p>It must have been at least three seconds before Piggot finally spoke: "All right, Calvert. I will."</p>

<p>"I'd really implore you to reconsider t- wait, actually?"</p>

<p>"I think you'll find that I am being completely serious," Piggot said. "In fact, we had a rather successful operation today."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>A bolt of nervous energy shot up Thomas' spine. Emily Piggot very rarely smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll be seeing an internal briefing soon, but I'll give you the cliff notes. Yesterday night, we were contacted by a particular vigilante who supposedly had detailed information about one of the city's supervillains."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"In fact, this vigilante was exactly the master that we've been hunting for. And the information they had to bring to the table was, well... extremely compelling."</p>

<p>"Was it Lung? I've heard rumours that he's recruiting," Thomas said.</p>

<p>"It was not, in fact, Lung. Rather, it was a local supervillain that we had been, up until now, ignoring."</p>

<p><i>Oh no.</i></p>

<p>Thomas resisted the urge to pull his secure phone out of his jacket.</p>

<p>"This might sound a bit extraordinary," Piggot continued, oblivious, "but it turns out Coil was a bona fide Bond supervillain. Underground base, absurdly over-engineered schemes, extremely frustrating self-destruct measures- ah, well, I'm sure you get the idea."</p>

<p>"Ah, really?" asked Thomas, putting all his acting chops into sounding equally oblivious.</p>

<p>"Indeed. He was even in the process of kidnapping the mayor's niece, believe it or not, when we intercepted his mercenaries. Unfortunately, we couldn't get at the information on his systems, due to an unexpected self-destruct mechanism, but we still cleared out three of his bases. He'll have a hard time regaining ground in the city. And, of course, to top it all off: the vigilante master was already targeting Coil, so we were able to successfully recruit them."</p>

<p>"Congratulations," Thomas said, mostly unable to put his heart into it.</p>

<p>"So, we'll be disbanding your little task force soon. Really, I should be the one doing the congratulating," said Piggot, "it looks like this is unlikely to torpedo your career after all. Of course, we'll have to demote you back to whatever position you had before, but I'll make it look like incompetent bureaucracy rather than a failing on your part." </p>

<p>She smiled again, and Thomas felt... odd. He'd interacted with Piggot several times, and never realized it was possible for her to be this happy. Or happy at all, even. Perhaps this was just the first true win she'd had in a long, long time.</p>

<p>That was a little depressing, actually. <i>Shame on the local criminals for beating down such a hardworking, stalwa- oh, right.</i></p>

<p>"I appreciate it," he said, finally, to fill the awkward silence.</p>

<p>"Well, it won't be hard. Regardless, I think we're done here. We'll meet tomorrow to discuss how best to disperse this gang of yours, for the maximum PR impact. If we've already gone through with something like this, we might as well see the benefits."</p>

<p>Later, in his car, Thomas finally pulled out his hidden phone.</p>

<p><i>931 unread messages | 79 missed calls</i></p>

<p>He marked them all as read and ordered pizza.</p>

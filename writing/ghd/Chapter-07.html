<p>A small sound alerted Thomas to a new text.</p>

<p><i>at bank. start?</i></p>

<p>In that reality, he responded: <i>go now</i></p>

<p>In the other, it took another two minutes to receive the text from Assault. He couldn't imagine why. Regardless, that fit well with what he was planning. He didn't respond, waiting as he placed a call in the first reality.</p>

<p><i>"Sir."</i></p>

<p>"MacArthur. What is the status of the bank robbery?"</p>

<p><i>"There's a strange man in a suit holding up the bank with a hunting rifle. I'm not sure how long he'll manage to keep everyone from running. He looks a bit ridiculous,"</i> the man replied. He'd never even questioned why Coil had sent him to stake out the bank, or how he had known there would be a robbery. Coil loved professionals. <i>"Otherwise, the police department has a few cars outside, but they're staying well back. The PRT isn't here yet."</i></p>

<p>In other words: No problems yet. Thomas grinned. "Perfect. I will call you again in ten minutes."</p>

<p><i>stay in the van for now</i>, he responded in the other reality.</p>

<p>He leaned back in an office chair, smiling. Ten minutes ago, he'd successfully taken his revenge on human resources by commandeering one of the nicest offices using a little-known SQL injection exploit in the scheduling system. He suspected this might lead to them finally figuring it out, but it was well worth it to see the face on one of human resource's grunts as he showed them his room booking.</p>

<p>In order to optimize his chances of success, Coil had a (relatively) simple plan. In his first universe, he'd allow both the kidnapping and the bank robbery to progress as intended. He had already made sure that one of his henchmen had phoned in the robbery, and one of his moles in the PRT had reported by text that the Wards, sans Aegis, had been deployed. That left exactly zero superheroes in the city that were capable of responding to the kidnapping. <i>Well, except for New Wave.</i> Thankfully, he was confident that they couldn't beat a cornered single parent, let alone a team of trained mercenaries.</p>

<p>While he was coordinating with Assault in that reality, Coil would keep the robbery from starting in the other; by staggering the start time, he was sure to already know of any potential problems that might arise in the first. </p>

<p>This was an incredibly clever application of his power, and Coil's only regret was that he had nobody to gloat to.</p>

<p>In the second reality, his phone rang.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>If Assault was being honest with himself - and why would he lie? - he wouldn't have called himself a particularly <i>patient</i> person. </p>

<p>Oh, sure, he could wait for things. He'd practised it before, several times. His personal record sat at one and a half minutes; to anyone who knew him, this was rather impressive.</p>

<p>The truth was, waiting was just not that fun. Especially when there was something important to do, like bothering his wife, watching a television show, or robbing a bank. Assault was a busy man; .</p>

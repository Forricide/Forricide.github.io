<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">  </p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil steepled his fingers. When he spoke, his voice was smooth: "That should be everyone. Seems Lung won’t be coming, though I doubt any of us are surprised, given the subject of tonight’s discussion."</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">“The Undersider's new cape,” Faultline replied. "Who, I imagine, is also responsible for the Merchants not showing up."</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, technically <i>Coil's</i> new cape, but (thankfully) only Tattletale knew that. All eyes were on her, the aforementioned parahuman relaxing in her booth seat. </p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">"They're smart to stay away from here," said Queen Ant. "After all, my Rebreeze Air Freshener<sup>tm</sup> is <b>excellent at removing smells that bug you</b>."</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">"Why is she allowed to be here, anyways?" asked Newter. "The Empire obviously isn't going to show up after what she did yesterday."</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">"Good riddance, I say."</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil glanced over at Trickster. He'd been rather shocked to find out that his past self in this continuity had recruited an entire additional parahuman team. Even more surprising, he'd apparently promised them a cure for a member of their team, who had been horrifically mutated by their power.</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Suffice it to say, he had absolutely no interest in keeping this timeline. All else aside, managing <i>two</i> groups of teenagers would annihilate his writing time.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"Good riddance or not, Newter is right," Faultline said. "We are mercenaries. If someone pays us to deal with the Master in our midst, we may consider taking them up on it. Otherwise, we'll be remaining neutral at this point. And, frankly, I don't see any interest in taking action from either your group or Coil."</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Master</i> is a harsh word," said Queen Ant. At the table, Grue moved to cover his face with his hand. "I prefer the term <i>influencer</i>."</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale, sitting across from Queen Ant, groaned.</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'd still like to know what exactly you did to the ABB," Trickster said. "We're new to the city, but I've heard of Lung's reputation."</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">Grue began: "I think we should adjourn-"</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">"Sure," said Queen Ant. "I had a lovely brand meeting with Lung just a couple weeks ago. His... group was <i>very</i> interested in my speech, sponsored by the Dracula Foundation: <b>Preventing gang violence may require some fang violence.</b>"</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">"...what does that even <i>mean</i>," said Spitfire from a booth.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">"It must have been a very moving speech, because they all turned themselves in that night. Bakuda seemed quite upset about that entire thing," Queen Ant continued. "It was all a misunderstanding, really. Actually, funny story, did you know she actually <i>didn't speak Japanese?</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Nobody said anything.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">"It's crazy, right! Fortunately, that's a problem easily fixed by Language Liberation<sup>®</sup>, <b>the absolutely necessary tool for levelling up your language skills.</b> You can join Bakuda in a free thirty-day trial by going to our website and using promo code QUEENANT8831. That's Q-U-E-"</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"Enough," said Faultline. "This meeting is a farce. Unless someone has something of <i>value</i> to contribute, or is going to compensate our group for our time here, we're leaving."</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">Trickster stood up, and cleared his throat. "Well, I just want to give my thanks to Queen Ant. Your calming medication-"</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">"You mean Purity Purges (patent pending), <b>the layman's solution for dealing with food cravings</b>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">"-yes, it is working startlingly well. We'll be placing another order later in the week."</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Faultline's Crew filed out of the bar after the Travelers, after Gregor took a sample of some stomach medication from Queen Ant. Apparently it would "settle your stomach like an invoice of negligible value", which Coil supposed was a suitably clever piece of branding to use on a mercenary.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">As Coil left the bar, he heard Queen Ant speak behind him: "The bill? Are you sure? I was going to post a <i>very</i> favourable review of your sweet little bar on social media. Trust me, the exposure is worth <i>much</i> more than this."</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"So, I heard you had a run-in with the Undersiders recently," Thomas said, sipping at a warm cup of sake.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung grunted and shuffled a couple letters around. The metal shackles did little to impede such small movements, which was good; Thomas hated unfair games (although any game he participated in was unfair, by virtue of his brimming intellect).</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">"They are irrelevant," said Lung, finally. He placed a few tiles on the board; <i>terror</i>, a measly twelve points.</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph">"I wouldn't have expected you to say that," Thomas responded, immediately playing <i>bloodied</i> for seventy-six points. "You seem to have been fairly shaken up, after all. What happened?"</p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung stared at the board. "You cheated."</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">"Of course not. You shuffled the tiles yourself. I merely took an opportunity."</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">A minute of silence passed, during which Thomas nearly finished his sake. Perhaps it had been unkind of him to only bring enough for himself. He was sure Lung would get over it eventually, ideally prior to any escape or release from prison.</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung played <i>stake</i> for seventy-five points.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"Now, that's cheating," said Thomas as he played played <i>Dracula</i> for fourteen points.</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung grunted. "Had to... deescalate." <i>Garlic</i>, eighteen points.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">"Deescalate?" Thomas laughed. "That's absolutely perfect. How did what she said, make you want that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas finished the last few drops of sake. He was somewhat curious, after all; the reason he'd given the PRT for the confidential interview wasn't entirely false. Queen Ant's power was nebulous enough that even his past self hadn't fully understood it, outside of the obvious. If entertaining Lung for a few minutes would get him more information, he wasn't going to complain.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">"A speech," Lung said. "Or an advertisement."</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas played <i>coffin</i> for ten points, and waited.</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">"They were going to send them after us."</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas blinked at the non sequitur. "I don't quite follow."</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">A beeping sound rang out from the door of the cell, indicating that his time was almost up; just another five minutes. Not enough time to finish the game, but that was never the reason he'd come.</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">"<i>Vampires.</i>"</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm sorry?"</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">"In the night. That would have been the PRT's solution," Lung said. He played  <i>holywater</i> for 68 points.</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"That's not a word, Lung. Never mind that you just... you can't just put it in the middle of nowhere like that. And how did you get nine tiles?"</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">Lung grunted.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">"I'm also not really following where vampires come into the picture."</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">"Leave."</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">"All right, all right," Thomas said, moving to sweep the letter tiles back into the bag he'd brought them in.</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">"Leave me the game."</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fine. But you're paying for drinks next time." Thomas sighed. "Who would have thought a teenager would drive you batty like this."</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">"Batty!" Lung exclaimed. "I am not... <i>batty</i>, or <i>dark</i>, or <i>vampiric</i>! I have <i>not</i> been turned into a vampire!" He emphasized the point by bringing one fist down on the card table Thomas had brought, scattering the game board and tiles across the room. A leg buckled under the blow, and the table teetered precariously for a moment before stabilizing.</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">"I am <i>not</i> batty," Lung repeated, suddenly calm. "I stopped it."</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas slowly backed away from the (former) gang leader, opening the door to the cell. "I see. That's all right, Lung. I'm just going to..."</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">"You're done?" asked a PRT officer from the hallway.</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yeah," Thomas said. He slipped through the door, glancing back at Lung. "He's a bit of a sore loser, so I thought I'd put a nail in the coffin of our conversation, as it were."</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">As the door closed behind him, Thomas could barely make out Lung raging incoherently.</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">As Coil had skipped across continuities, each one with more accumulated changes than the last, he'd slowly discovered that he was not the most <i>common</i> Coil.</p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">Well, that was not the best way to put it. It was perhaps more accurate to state that he was not a normal Coil. He was, of course, above average - but the literate reader would already know this.</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">Frankly, the past-Coils he'd been learning about were simply bizarre in their methods. Only a few continuities ago, he'd found notes suggesting that his past self had planned to (presumably) <i>hire</i> Dinah Alcott with drugs. Hire! Had his past self not understood how expensive drugs could be? Or - worse? - had they simply undervalued their own mentorship <i>so much</i> that they hadn't realized that Alcott would surely have jumped at such an excellent opportunity?</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph"> </p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">That wasn't the least of it. Other than the current continuity's Coil hiring the Travelers (a <i>massive</i> financial and mental burden, and frankly, willingly placing a monster in his own basement was idiotic, at least for someone with the brainpower and predictive capabilities of Coil) he'd counted no less than <i>four</i> instances of past-Coils hiring Tattletale at gunpoint. At <i>gunpoint!</i> Not only was that against the unwritten rules, it was frankly barbaric.</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">In each of those continuities, he'd made sure to take the time to let Tattletale know that he had no interest in ever having her shot. Instead, if she betrayed him, he'd simply release his Tattletale x Faultline fanfiction. He'd found that a <i>far</i> better motivator, thus far.</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph">Regardless, this information had presented a secondary problem. Not only did he need to research the current state of things - as the snowball effect from a single parahuman's power being different was, frankly, absurd - he also had to account for the fact that his past-self may have done some <i>very</i> strange things. As improbably as it may have been, he'd even discovered that some hadn't read <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">For shame.</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">Fortunately, Coil had a genius idea for how to regain some of his reputation losses. After the Undersiders had released an advertisement for a re-release of <i>Minesweeper</i>, Bakuda's already uncommon forays into contested territory had completely stopped. The Protectorate had taken her into custody in the morning; an informer called the event "disturbing". </p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">The Protectorate had taken the good PR in stride. Coil, as Thomas, had received several emails regarding a potential fundraiser being planned for the weekend. Coil supposed that with Lung's gang off the map, Armsmaster had finally been able to take a day off to sign underwear, or whatever he did at fundraisers.</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">A dozen heroes or heroically aligned, superhuman individuals would all be present at the fundraiser, with their guards let down. Perhaps drinking, even.</p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">This was an excellent opportunity.</p></a>

<a name="pg73"><p class="content-paragraph">In fact, Coil had created a plan long ago for this very occasion.</p></a>

<a name="pg74"><p class="content-paragraph">In both realities (which the astute reader will understand had been kept in sync for this very plan), Coil phoned Tattletale.</p></a>

<a name="pg75"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Oh hey, Coil. I was just going to call you."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg76"><p class="content-paragraph">"Ah, then you have already predicted my proposition," Coil said in both realities, leaning back in his chair.</p></a>

<a name="pg77"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Uh, no, actually. I was going to ask if you'd heard of Pepper Smith's Bottled Water."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg78"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil grimaced. "Bottled water? That's a horrific waste of plastic." Frankly, <i>nothing</i> made Coil angrier than such a blatant environmental concern. You could hardly take over the world if it was covered in plastic.</p></a>

<a name="pg79"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I thought you'd agree. Have you seen their current marketing campaign? They're telling people that</i> 'When you return your empty bottles, we'll bring them back to the mountain we collected your Fresh Water<sup>tm</sup> from!<i>"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg80"><p class="content-paragraph">"No! How could they?!" Coil slammed his desk with one hand, wine bottle wobbling precariously.</p></a>

<a name="pg81"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I know, right? It's crazy. Anyways, what'd you have for me?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg82"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil punched the wall. His hand was, unfortunately, slightly less resilient. "Frankly, Tattletale, that news is <i>quite</i> upsetting." He took a deep breath, not to calm himself, but to deal with the pain of bruising his knuckles. "But no matter. I will deal with that in due time. The PRT will be holding a fundraiser on Saturday. I want you to be there, and create a distraction for me."</p></a>

<a name="pg83"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I'm sorry, what? Why? And a distraction for</i> what, <i>exactly?"</i> </p></a>

<a name="pg84"><p class="content-paragraph">"Irrelevant. I will pay the Undersiders-" Coil briefly glanced at the financial documents he had open, then realized they were irrelevant, considering he planned to abandon this continuity within a week- "two hundred thousand dollars, total, to create this distraction."</p></a>

<a name="pg85"><p class="content-paragraph">Silence.</p></a>

<a name="pg86"><p class="content-paragraph">"I believe it is a fair sum," Coil said.</p></a>

<a name="pg87"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Yeah, no, that's fair. I'll discuss it with the team."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg88"><p class="content-paragraph">"Goodbye, Tattletale." Coil hang up the phone.</p></a>

<a name="pg89"><p class="content-paragraph">This was his chance. Something he'd always wanted to do, but had always been prevented from doing through circumstance, or bad timing, or the fact that - frankly - the entire concept was rather inefficient.</p></a>

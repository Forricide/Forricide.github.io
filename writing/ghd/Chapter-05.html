<p>Today, Coil was meeting his team of supervillains.</p>

<p>Wait, no, that was wrong. Today, <i>Thomas Calvert</i> was meeting his team of parahumans. Because, of course, this wasn't a group that his preferred persona had assembled. Rather, this... collection of capes had been <i>forced</i> on him. Mere words could not even hope to express his disgust at this particular eventuality.</p>

<p><i>Calm down, Thomas. You just need to manage this long enough to hear back from Brittage. Just... that... lo-</i></p>

<p>"Heeey! You must be, ah, the green cow? Green cow, you know, <i>Cowvert</i>? Something like that, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Ah yes, that deep, gravelly, and unbelievably irratating voice. In the past, he had used timelines with <i>extreme</i> prejudice to avoid working with this man. Of course, his name had been the first one on Piggot's list. Such was the nature of the cruel, ever-targeted hand of fate.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Assault."</p>

<p>The man in question grinned, shaking his head. "No, no, monsieur. You can call me... <i>Le Voleur</i>! For I am the - er, ze thief in ze night! <i>Le terreur</i> of Brockton Bay!"</p>

<p>"Take a seat, Assault."</p>

<p>Now that his team was fully assembled, Thomas took a moment to survey the (rather pitiful) assortment of capes. It wasn't exactly what he would have called a <i>team</i>, although he wasn't going to say that out loud. He'd been given part-time management of Dauntless and Velocity, apparently Aegis had volunteered for experience, and of course Assault was there for "as long as he needed". </p>

<p>A group of mediocre heroes, and he had to make them - what, <i>acceptable target villains</i>? He'd sent a few emails, ten texts, and a set of nicely-packaged letters (using stationary!) to Piggot asking for some kind of clarifaction, but had yet to hear back. Unsurprisingly, his twenty-five pleading voicemails hadn't managed to elicit a response, either. </p>

<p>"I'm guessing you're wondering why I've called you all here today," Thomas said, finally breaking out of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I heard there were things I could break without it coming out of my pay," Assault said.</p>

<p>"The Director told me that if I participated in this, I might get a raise up to minimum wage," added Velocity.</p>

<p>"This counts as community service, right?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>Thomas put down his phone, closing a dating app in the same motion. "Ah, I think I caught all of that. Sounds good. Dauntless. Why don't you explain what this little group is for?"</p>

<p>"For sure! So, this is all the result of an <i>amazing</i> idea that the Director and, um..."</p>

<p>"Call me Thomas."</p>

<p>"Thomas, here, had. An idea they had. A great idea! Yes, right. So, as you probably know, there's a new master cape in the city. And they're really, really strong. So we're forming this honeypot supervillain team, hoping that they target us-" </p>

<p>"Sorry, what's a honeypot?" asked Velocity.</p>

<p>"It's like bait," Aegis said. "Something you can afford to lose, that you place out in an obvious location, hoping to bait someone into going for it."</p>

<p>Thomas played <i>murderer</i> in his online word game for seventy-eight points.</p>

<p>"That's exactly it," Dauntless continued. "Anyways, that's essentially the idea. We'll form a supervillain team, wait for this vigilante to target us, and then use that to get in contact with the master themselves!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be easier to just put out a bulletin asking this supposedly-heroic cape to contact us?" asked Aegis. "Like a post online, or a television announcement, or..."</p>

<p>Assault shook his head. "That wouldn't get you service hours, kid. And it would be low risk - or, in other words, low fun."</p>

<p>Velocity nodded sagely. This was his area of expertise. "I've been doing investigative duties since I started working for the Protectorate. I wouldn't be able to put food on the table if it wasn't for that particular source of billable hours. I don't even need to worry about getting too good at it and running out of work, because there's this one kid named 'Browbeat' that's just completely impossible to find, anyways."</p>

<p>"So, Thomas. How are you planning to kick this off? Maybe we go sell some drugs, beat up some kids, something like that?"</p>

<p>Coil grinned, leaning forward and steepling his fingers. Then he remembered where he was, and became Thomas again, relaxing and patting the desk with his hands. <i>Nothing suspicious here at all.</i> "In fact, I was thinking of executing a plan I've had for a while: to rob a bank."</p>

<p>"A plan... you've had for a while?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>"Oh, er," Thomas said, "just in case this exact scenario happened. I like to plan ahead."</p>

<p>"Very clever," said Velocity. "But, and I'm telling you this off the record, you might be working too hard. Have you heard of using work hours to plan your vacations, instead? It's quite pleasant."</p>

<p>"Ah, no. I don't take vacations."</p>

<p>"Oh dear," said Velocity.</p>

<p>Aegis looked like he wanted to say something, so Thomas took that chance to continue forward into an explanation. "It's actually rather simple. We'll make our move on Thursday. I'll provide information from off-site where possible; the four of you will break in, threaten the customers as is appropriate, steal a bit of money, and blitz your way through whoever shows up."</p>

<p>"Assault, Velocity, and Dauntless are all fast," Aegis said, "but I fly really slowly. How would I escape?"</p>

<p>"Superheroes are like "</p>

<p>He picked up the phone.</p>

<p>Four words, barely audible.</p>

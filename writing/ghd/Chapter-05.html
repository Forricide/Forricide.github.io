<p>Today, Coil was meeting his team of supervillains.</p>

<p>Wait, no, that was wrong. Today, <i>Thomas Calvert</i> was meeting his team of "supervillains". Because, of course, this wasn't a group that his preferred persona had assembled. Rather, this... collection of capes had been <i>forced</i> on him. Mere words could not even hope to express his disgust at this particular eventuality.</p>

<p><i>Calm down, Thomas. You just need to manage this long enough to hear back from Brittage. Just... that... lo-</i></p>

<p>"Heeey! You must be, ah, the green cow? Green cow, you know, <i>Cowvert</i>? Something like that, <i>hein</i>?" </p>

<p>Ah yes, that deep, gravelly, and unbelievably irratating voice. In the past, he had dispatched realities with <i>extreme</i> prejudice to avoid working with this man. Of course, his name had been the first one on Piggot's list. Such was the nature of the cruel, ever-targeted hand of fate.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Assault."</p>

<p>The man in question grinned, shaking his head. "No, no, monsieur. You can call me... <i>Le Voleur</i>! For I am the - er, ze thief in ze night! <i>Le terreur</i> of Brockton Bay!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you take a seat, Assault."</p>

<p>Now that his team was fully assembled, Thomas took a moment to survey the (rather pitiful) assortment of capes. It wasn't exactly what he would have called a <i>team</i>, although he wasn't going to say that out loud. He'd been given part-time management of Dauntless and Velocity, apparently Aegis had volunteered for experience, and of course Assault was there for "as long as he needed".</p>

<p>In terms of raw strength, the team was above average. Unfortunately, in every other way, they were underwhelming. Velocity was the least impressive of the bunch, with a power that Thomas understood as <i>running away from things</i>. If Thomas was being entirely honest with himself (and he always was; he knew he would understand) the entire concept of powers that allowed the user to get away from things was ridiculous. Running away was for cowards, and Thomas was most certainly not one.</p>

<p>The others weren't particularly impressive, but at least they had some potential. </p>

<p>The Ward, Aegis, wasn't really capable of much, with a power that essentially allowed him to, well, <i>not</i> run away from things. Not a whole lot of synergy there. At least he seemed to be willing to learn, asking several thought-provoking questions upon arrival like <i>"Why did Director Piggot say 'I'm sorry' when I signed up for this?"</i> and <i>"Are we actually sitting in lawn chairs?"</i> and <i>"Is there a microwave to heat up my tuna sandwich?"</i>. </p>

<p>Assault might have been useful, if he wasn't nauseatingly difficult to work with. They hadn't started, and the man had already managed to break his lawn chair. At least he was relatively competent with his power.</p>

<p>And the final member, Dauntless, was the local Protectorate's golden child, probably only assigned to this task force because someone mispelled "Triumph". Unfortunately, Thomas had no idea what his power did, as the official briefing on <i>that</i> had been much longer than his attention span.</p>

<p>A group of mediocre heroes, and he had to make them - what, <i>acceptable target villains</i>? He'd sent a few emails, ten texts, and a set of nicely-packaged letters (using stationary!) to Piggot asking for some kind of clarifaction, but had yet to hear back. Unsurprisingly, his twenty-five pleading voicemails hadn't managed to elicit a response, either. </p>

<p>Oh well. <i>This is all temporary, Calvert,</i> he reminded himself. There was nothing to do except move forward.</p>

<p>"I'm guessing you're wondering why I've called you all here today," Thomas said, finally breaking out of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I heard there were things I could break without it coming out of my pay," Assault said.</p>

<p>"The Director told me that if I participated in this, I might get my pay raised up to minimum wage," added Velocity.</p>

<p>"This counts as community service, right?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>Thomas put down his phone, closing a dating app in the same motion. "Ah, I think I caught all of that. Sounds good. Dauntless. Why don't you explain what this little group is for?"</p>

<p>"For sure! So, this is all the result of an <i>amazing</i> idea that the Director and, um..."</p>

<p>"Call me Thomas."</p>

<p>"Thomas, here, had. An idea they had. A great idea! Yes, right. So, as you probably know, there's a new master cape in the city. And they're really, really strong. So we're forming this honeypot supervillain team, hoping that they target us-" </p>

<p>"Sorry, what's a honeypot?" asked Velocity.</p>

<p>"It's like bait," Aegis said. "Something you can afford to lose, that you place out in an obvious location, hoping to bait someone into going after it. Like that time Armsmaster created ten kilograms of meth to attempt to capture Skidmark."</p>

<p>Thomas played <i>murderer</i> in an online word game for seventy-eight points.</p>

<p>"That's exactly it," Dauntless continued. "Anyways, that's essentially the idea. We'll form a supervillain team, wait for this vigilante to target us, and then use that to get in contact with the master themselves!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be easier to just put out a bulletin asking this supposedly-heroic cape to contact us?" asked Aegis. "Like a post online, or a television announcement, or..."</p>

<p>Assault shook his head. "That wouldn't get you service hours, kid. And it would be low risk - or, in other words, low fun."</p>

<p>Velocity nodded sagely. This was his area of expertise. "I've been doing investigative duties since I started working for the Protectorate. I wouldn't be able to put food on the table if it wasn't for that particular source of billable hours. I don't even need to worry about getting too good at it and running out of work, because there's this one kid named 'Browbeat' that's just completely impossible to find, anyways. I think half my hours in the last year have been on that case."</p>

<p>"So, Thomas. How are you planning to kick this off? Maybe we go sell some drugs, beat up some kids, design a ponzi scheme, something like that?" asked Assault.</p>

<p>This was where Coil's master stroke truly came into play. When reading over the most recent weeks' reports from this continuity, he'd discovered that one of his minions had been more successful than normal. The precognitive he'd been looking into had been both confirmed and fully identified. Now, all he needed was an opportunity - a way to distract the Protectorate, so his men could acquire her for him.</p>

<p>This was his most beautiful plot.</p>

<p>Coil grinned, leaning forward and steepling his fingers. Then he remembered where he was, and became Thomas again, relaxing and patting the desk with his hands. <i>Nothing suspicious here at all.</i> "In fact, I was thinking of executing a plan I've had for a while: to rob a bank."</p>

<p>"A plan... you've had for a while?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>"Oh, er," Thomas said, "just in case this exact scenario happened. I like to plan ahead."</p>

<p>"Very clever," said Velocity. "But, and I'm telling you this off the record, you might be working too hard. Have you heard of using billable hours to plan your vacations, instead? It's quite pleasant."</p>

<p>"Ah, no. I don't take vacations."</p>

<p>"Oh dear," said Velocity.</p>

<p>Aegis looked like he wanted to say something, so Thomas took that chance to continue forward into an explanation. "It's actually rather simple. We'll make our move on Thursday. I'll provide information and coordination from off-site where possible; the four of you will break in, threaten the customers to an appropriate degree, steal a bit of money, and blitz your way through whoever shows up."</p>

<p>"Assault, Velocity, and Dauntless are all fast," Aegis said, "but I fly really slowly. How would I escape?"</p>

<p>"Superheroes are like cats, they love batting at strings," Coil said. "Except, in this metaphor, the strings are your intestines, and the cats are your former colleagues. That is to say, you will be able to escape by distracting them with your intestines."</p>

<p>Assault nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Intestines are very distracting," said Dauntless. "I have nightmares about them, sometimes." </p>

<p>"Exactly. Keeping that in mind, it should be easy enough to distract a large portion of the Wards and Protectorate - especially considering that you four will be, well, preoccupied - for a good half hour."</p>

<p>"Distract them?" Aegis frowned. "Isn't the point to just steal money?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well, you see, the more heroes you escape from, the greater your reputation will grow. The longer you stay there, the more likely it'll be that you grow infamous, and from there it's just a matter of time before this new master seeks you out."</p>

<p>"Uh, can I ask a question? It's about the, you know, overall plan."</p>

<p>Thomas, still unwilling to use his power, was forced to <i>imagine</i> torturing the child. Horrors. Was this what normal people had to endure? "Yes, Aegis?"</p>

<p>"How do we know that this will even lead to us locating the master? What if their power is long-range? Then, if they're careful, they'd never even come close to us. We'd never get any information."</p>

<p>"That's a good question, Aegis. Does anyone else have any questions?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Do we have to run away?" Assault leaned forward. "I was thinking we could take a more, ah, <i>offense-based</i> approach to this. You know, fight, not flight."</p>

<p>"You want to <i>fight</i> the Protectorate?" Dauntless shook his head firmly. "You can't do that! It's illegal."</p>

<p>"Actually, robbing a bank is also illegal," said Aegis. </p>

<p>"Exactly," Dauntless said. "Which is why I think this is a very bad plan. I didn't sign up for this to, well, <i>commit crimes</i>."</p>

<p>"If you think about it, it's actually not morally wrong," Assault said (to a nod from Thomas). "We're not stealing from normal people or anything like that, we're stealing from a bank. And banks have insurance, so in reality, we're hurting the real villains: Insurance companies. It's the (ethically) perfect plot!"</p>

<p>"I completely agree. In any case, it seems like these questions are mostly unimportant; perhaps it's time to adjourn. I can see you're all completely on board with this, so there's nothing more to discuss." Coil clasped his hands somewhat menacingly on the desk. "We'll meet together in the morning before the robbery. Because you're currently under my supervision, you won't need to let anyone know what you're doing. I'll make sure it's covered in all the proper channels."</p>

<p>After that, it didn't take much more convincing for the room to empty. The minimum amount of time that could be payrolled was four hours; if they were smart, his four new underlings would be able to relax for three and a half of them.</p>

<p>It had been an odd few days for Coil. After he had initially recovered from his impromptu meeting with Piggot, he had started researching what had changed in this continuity. He'd slowly discovered many minute differences; for example, the Undersiders were alive once again, and still working for him. But, more importantly, he'd apparently acquired certain information that he hadn't before.</p>

<p>Yes, he'd confirmed the presence and identity of a certain child precognitive. Well, technically, one of his unimportant minions had done so, but they had done so using <i>his</i> resources, so he'd more or less completed the entire investigation by himself. </p>

<p>Dinah Alcott. Niece of one of the more dangerous people that Coil could aggravate... one of the most successful local businessmen, the mayor of the city, a millionaire by hard work... Thomas' favourite person to fleece in poker. He was practically salivating at the thought. Ah, yes, when he was through with little Dinah, her uncle wouldn't even recognize her. It would be fitting revenge for that one game of tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p>The main difficulty was, Coil was accustomed to working with more options than he currently had. His inventive mind had managed to finagle this cursed team that had been forced upon him into a distraction to allow for even a possibilitiy of success; despite that, if he wanted to be safe, he'd only be able to commit a single timeline to the kidnapping. At that point, the divergence would begin to grow, and he'd start to lose the benefits of having mostly-synced information.</p>

<p>And then Coil had a particularly important realization. He <i>could</i> commit both timelines to kidnapping the Alcott girl. If he didn't succeed in one or both realities, it didn't really matter in the long run. He'd have to use his power <i>eventually</i> - the entire reason he'd stayed in this continuity so long was the implicit danger of switching, and to gather as much information as he could. With any luck, any mistakes he made would be smoothed out by a gentle massaging of fate. Not that he <i>could</i> make mistakes, of course. That would be contradictory.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yes, Coil's plan was even better than he'd thought it was. Not that he'd ever thought it anything less than perfect; it had simply become perfecter with time, like wine aging in the Endbringer shelter he'd converted into a wine cellar.</p>

<p>If things were already going so well, he had no doubt the bank robbery would progress as planned.</p>

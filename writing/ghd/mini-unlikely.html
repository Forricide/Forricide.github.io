<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">"Banhammer. You know," Thomas said, gesturing vaguely about himself, "like on PHO, when a mod bans someone, they're giving them the <i>banhammer</i>."</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">Piggot frowned. "What's a P-H-O?"</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">"Fanfiction? What's that?"</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas checked his watch. "Yep, I've actually got to run, talk to you later Emily!"</p></a></body>

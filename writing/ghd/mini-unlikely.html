<p class="content-paragraph">"I haven't done Chemistry since tenth grade, Thomas. I don't remember these things."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas blinked. "I can't believe you're actually not on PHO. Everyone who's anyone uses it!"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Thomas, if this is one of those new gags like that dihydrogen monoxide thing - that wasn't funny, by the way - or similar, it's still not funny."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"What?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"So you can get advice about technical stuff there? Are there a lot of web administrators?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Uh... well, it's really mostly local discussion and fanfiction..."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Fanfiction? What's that?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas checked his watch. "Yep, I've actually got to run, talk to you later Emily!"</p>

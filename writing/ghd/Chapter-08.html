The Protectorate really took advantage of this, do you think the E88 planned everything for this reaction somehow?

<!--Sort of problematic, actually, that there doesn't appear to be a good BBCode to HTML transpiler. So I think the obvious solution is to add that to my compiler, instead of writing more. Insert XKCD here. :)-->

<!--The transpiler should probably convert BBCode to our Markdown superset (using comments like [[!]] for center, etc), then from that to HTML/BBCode.-->

<!--Temporary (read: probably permanent) hacky solution (May 11, 2020): Have added BBCode conversion to markdown templater. Sort of.-->

<p><i>Why do I even bother,</i> Thomas thought, closing the tab, and switching his browser out of Villain Mode. Ever since the Simurgh had targeted every non-Comcast ISP, he hadn't been able to get a phone data plan that consistently worked. Although some people seemed to think this was a huge problem to Life As We Know It, Thomas had actually found that this had greatly increased his productivity, allowing for far more time spent writing, drinking, and plotting not-evil-in-context schemes.</p>

<p>This was the only situation where he really hated it. Sitting on the bus, he didn't really have anything to do, because his car had broken down <i>again</i>. Oh, did he miss Japanese auto companies.</p>

<p>Ah well. He had things to think about. </p>

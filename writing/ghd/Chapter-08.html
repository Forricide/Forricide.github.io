<p><!--No HTML here quite yet!-->

<!--Sort of problematic, actually, that there doesn't appear to be a good BBCode to HTML transpiler. So I think the obvious solution is to add that to my compiler, instead of writing more. Insert XKCD here. :)-->

<!--The transpiler should probably convert BBCode to our Markdown superset (using comments like [[!]] for center, etc), then from that to HTML/BBCode.-->

<!--Temporary (read: probably permanent) hacky solution (May 11, 2020): Have added BBCode conversion to markdown templater. Sort of.-->
<!--Note: It actually works, which is impressive. TODO - Need to support [indent] tags. But it's readable. Sort of.-->

<!--Also, this WYSIWYG markdown editor has a really nice colour/font for HTML comments. Cool! Where's the Vim support, though?-->

<p><i>Why do I even bother?</i> </p>

<p>Thomas closed the tab, switching his browser out of Villain Mode. Ever since the Simurgh had targeted every non-Comcast ISP, he hadn't been able to find a phone data plan that consistently worked. Although some people seemed to think this was a huge problem to Life As We Know It, Thomas had found that this had greatly increased his productivity, allowing for far more time spent writing, drinking, and plotting not-evil-in-context schemes. (Or developing the convoluted contexts necessary for such plans)</p>

<p>This was the only situation where he really couldn't stand it. Sitting on the bus, he didn't have anything to do, because his car had broken down <i>again</i>. Oh, did he miss the days of Japanese auto companies.</p>

<p>It had been three days since the disastrous 'distraction' that had been the bank robbery. He didn't miss the irony that the undertaking meant to distract the Protectorate from his actions had instead distracted him from the Protectorate's; in fact, this thought had kept him up at night, although that might have also been the pizza at work. </p>

<p>For those past few days, he'd hardly done anything but the tasks Piggot had laid out for him. Soullessly, mindlessly, for once the true image of a PRT employee. Yesterday afternoon, he'd even been given a raise.</p>

<p>It didn't matter. None of it mattered anymore.</p>

<p>That first morning, Thomas had looked into all of his resources. Bank accounts, minions, even the Undersiders had been taken from him. <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i> had step-by-step guides for the first two, but not at the same time; without money, he wouldn't have a chance of finding well-trained employees - and without mercenaries, who would do the hard work of getting money in the first place?</p>

<p>He might have been abandoned, destitute, and (almost) out of options, but he wasn't going to the dirty work himself.</p>

<p><i>None of this is permanent,</i> Thomas told himself. He was hardly keeping track of the differences between realities, making use of the split less to gather information like he'd intended and more to ingest twice as much comfort food. It was hard to keep himself focused, to try and accomplish anything, when the day it would all vanish was approaching.</p>

<p>Thomas figured he'd wait until his fridge was empty, then merge the universes to use his power again. It wasn't like waiting could really <i>hurt</i> him. With some measure of luck, he'd end up in a continuity where his past self had been successful, and all would be well once more.</p>

<p>In a sense, he supposed it was comfortable, knowing that he didn't need to do anything to succeed.</p>

<p><i>As long as my new-past-self didn't think the same way...</i></p>

<p>Thomas made it in to the PRT Headquarters half an hour early. It was often necessary for him to leave so early; frequently his morning commute would be interrupted by some sort of superpowered throwdown, even as often as three or four times a week. He hated Brockton Bay's gangs. Ruining the city, really.</p>

<p><i>Ding.</i> The elevator doors opened slowly, and he walked in, joining the two people who were already inside.</p>

<p>"Heeey, buddy," Assault said, "Why the long face?"</p>

<p>The butterfly effect, Thomas thought, couldn't possibly exist. Assault's voice was equally grating in both realities, although he was standing on different sides of the elevator.</p>

<p>"I am contemplating the best method to dispose of your body," Thomas said in one reality. In the other: "Just a case of the Monday's."</p>

<p>In both, Assault just laughed, patting Thomas on the back.</p>

<p>Infuriating.</p>

<p>It took far too long for the elevator to reach his floor. Unfortunately, Assault followed him off, talking about some inane topic (the ethics of the birdcage? who cared about <i>ethics</i>?). He wracked his brain for any reason that Assault would also need to be on this particular floor; the only office of note was, well, Thomas'.</p>

<p>"So Assault, what can I do for you today?" Thomas asked in one reality, sitting peacefully behind his desk.</p>

<p>In the other, he had already turned around and left the building. Mental health days were a new benefit, after all.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm looking for information on our next job. If you get what I mean."</p>

<p>"No, actually, I- you're referring to the fake gang?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's getting boring, waiting at home," Assault said, leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p>"The master's already been contacted - didn't the director tell you?"</p>

<p>"Huh? What master?"</p>

<p>Thomas buried his head in his hands. "Don't you watch the news?"</p>

<p>"Nah, they're too depressing. Some random cape's trial is coming up, and they're probably gonna be pushing for the birdcage... and it just makes me ask, how is that ethical? We really need to inspect our moral values as-"</p>

<p>"Get out of my office."</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>When he wasn't working, or plotting his complete takeover of the city, Thomas also enjoyed the simple pleasures.</p>

<p>Many would call Brockton Bay a dump. The ones that wouldn't, likely had stronger words; unfortunately, Thomas couldn't consciously think them, as he had been working for several weeks on making his mind PG-compatible in anticipation of capturing that precognitive child. </p>

<p>It wouldn't do to have CPS come down on him, after all. He wasn't sure quite how that entire system worked, but he wasn't taking any chances.</p>

<p>Regardless. Brockton Bay was, unfortunately, a very sub-par city. In fact, it had ranked top three on <i>McLame's Twenty Worst Places to Live in North America</i> five years in a row, with only Manitoba consistently doing worse.</p>

<p>This was something he planned to eventually fix. He had long intended to do so by himself, hand-moulding the city into a peaceful, perfect eastern location. If that didn't work, then more recently he'd had an alternate option open up - simply brute-force finding a continuity where the city was perfect (i.e., had him in all positions of power).</p>

<p>For now, however... he still had this. Standing on the roof of the PRT Headquarters, he could almost see to the north-west corner of the city. The afternoon sun shone through a thin layer of clouds, reflecting across the bay proper. He let it warm him, his suit jacket temporarily discarded. </p>

<p>Looking out across the city like this, taking it in from a comfortable distance, he could almost forget its flaws. Perhaps nature had a way of doing that, taking the edge off of humanity's worst creations.</p>

<p>Or maybe that was just the alcohol talking.</p>

<p>Sure, he technically wasn't supposed to drink on the job. But who really cared about technicalities?</p>

<p>Thomas walked up to the edge of the roof, leaning on the railing. He hadn't spent that much time actually working, today. Instead of doing any of the paperwork Piggot had forwarded him, he'd found himself thinking about what he'd do if the next use of his power didn't cause drastic changes to the tempral continuity.</p>

<p>It was, he figured, something he should have probably considered earlier.</p>

<p>After all, everything that had happened so far could have been unrelated to him. Just a strange string of coincidences, perhaps a reality-altering cape involved... well, he was having a hard time remembering everything, but he imagined it was possible.</p>

<p>It was enough of a concern that he'd found it hard to focus on work. And so he'd come up here, pondering life and reality and the time-and-space continuum...</p>

<p>And he'd closed his other reality, leaving him a singular man for the past thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Thomas hadn't expected how sobering it would be, to be present in only one world for such a long time. He couldn't remember the last time he'd done this; hunting through his memory, it was possible that the last time he'd only existed in a single reality for more than ten contiguous minutes had been <i>before he got his powers.</i></p>

<p>Was that somehow linked to how much <i>realer</i> the world seemed now that he was perceiving it through only a single pair of eyes, viewing it with just one mind?</p>

<p>Nah, that was probably the alcohol, too.</p>

<p>He stood on the precipice, metaphorical trigger just inches away from his even more metaphorical finger. Would everything shift again, when he activated his power? Would it all stay the same?</p>

<p>He had no way of knowing, and that was terrifying just as much as it was strangely thrilling.</p>

<p>Thomas took a deep breath -</p>

<p>And his hidden phone, slowly collecting dust in his shirt pocket, rang.</p>

<p><i>What?</i> His criminal empire had been fully dismantled - or so he'd thought. Was there still someone out there, some minion he'd forgotten about, who hadn't heard the news?</p>

<p>Or was it Accord, phoning for the fourth time in three days to mock him for being so imcompetent?</p>

<p>Some fatalistic feeling drove him to pull out the phone. He didn't even bother to check caller ID before accepting the call, placing the phone to his ear.</p>

<p>Someone spoke. Their voice sounded distant, weary, as if the speaker was barely managing the call before falling asleep.</p>

<p>They didn't say much.</p>

<p>Four words, barely audible.</p>

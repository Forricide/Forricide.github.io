<p>He picked up the phone.</p>

<p>Four words, barely audible.</p>

<p>"It's Taylor Hebert, sir." <i>click</i></p>

<p>Thomas stared at the phone. He'd answered after two rings, and that one sentence had been the only thing the speaker had said before hanging up. A prank call?</p>

<p>Then he remembered: <i>"I only need a name, Batters."</i></p>

<p>His henchman had come through. Thomas had his name, and with it, free rein to abandon this godforsaken temporal continuity entirely. He considered his options. Did he call up Piggot to gloat? Push Assault off a building of above average height? He was still marvelling at how he'd been able to make it this long, with no chance for mental release since - he checked his watch - ah, ten hours ago. Perhaps he <i>had</i> been getting a bit dependant on that. Oh well.</p>

<p>Piggot's office was down two flights of stairs and across a large room of cubicles. He walked past the plebeian office workers without a second thought, only stopping once he had entered the doorway of the director's questionably decorated office.</p>

<p>"Calvert. What do you need?"</p>

<p>Thomas stared into her eyes, opened his mouth - and then stopped.</p>

<p>What was he doing? He could see the weary look in her eyes, the way her entire expression seemed to drag. That same exhaustion he'd had a taste of, trying to manage even four incompetent superheroes.</p>

<p>He - no. This couldn't be. He was <i>empathizing</i> with her? That wasn't something he'd done since...</p>

<p>Thomas cut off that train of thought. Piggot was staring at him, about to ask another question. He didn't want to hear it.</p>

<p>Frowning, Thomas used his power.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>For years, Coil had used two timelines in a delicate way. A timeline could be a way to find some emotional release, gain information invisibly, or make high-reward plays with absolutely no risk. All this time, his power had necessitated a delicate balance. </p>

<p>But what could he do with <i>sixteen</i>?</p>

<p>In one timeline, he drank coffee with Lung, discussing the most recent edition of <i>Supervillain Seasonals</i> (<i>Illegal Teens: How to recruit youth for your gang</i>). Lung argued that youth were perfect targets for gang membership; Coil tried in vain to convince him that well-paid mercenaries were far better at following instructions.</p>

<p>In another, he took in the sight that was his desk. One, two, four - twenty-three empty beer cans. An impressive run. He got up to use the washroom.</p>

<p>Five more timelines were taken up with similar tasks; in some others, he sent his underlings out on moderately risky tasks.</p>

<p>He'd been in this continuity for two days, and he was starting to get used to it. If he'd been apathetic to things before, well.</p>

<p>In another timeline, he laughed at footage of the PRT building going up in flames. "This is great, Kerby! Do you think you can do the rig next week?"</p>

<p>"Sir, with all due respect, I think that-"</p>

<p>"That's great! Man, I'd kill to see Piggot's face right now. Literally."</p>

<p>"That would be easier if you hadn't ordered us to make her 'sleep with the fishes', sir."</p>

<p>"I'm a long term planner, Kerby. Don't undermine me here."</p>

<p>That was when, in his most important timeline, the phone finally rang.</p>

<p>"Butters."</p>

<p>"It's Britters, sir."</p>

<p>"Britters, then. What do you have to report?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've investigated the girl - Taylor Hebert. It was rather slow, until I found out a crucial piece of information."</p>

<p>Coil leaned back in his chair. "And what was that, Britters?"</p>

<p>"You recruited her a month ago, sir."</p>

<p>He made a note in timeline 8, where his wrist was becoming increasingly sore. </p>

<p>"It appears that she nearly died to Lung before the Undersiders saved her. Her power allows her to upgrade capes with a strange ritual. Quite frankly, I'm not sure how she ended up fighting Lung in the first place, but I'm sure additional investigation would uncover more in that area."</p>

<p>Coil played with a USB on his desk. "I don't think that will be a problem. You've done marvellously here, Britters. Marvellously."</p>

<p>This peculiar mystery of Coil's was finally coming to an end. Despite everything, his powerful intellect had prevailed, and he was prepared to make a rather bold hypothesis: Every time he used his power, that one girl, Taylor Hebert, triggered with a different power. And when that happened, history rewrote itself.</p>

<p>A perplexing phenomenon, but one that Coil was confident he could solve with a careful application of bullets to heads. After all, there was no point using his power if he undid all of his work up until that point. This was the time for action.</p>

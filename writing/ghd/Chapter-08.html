<!--No HTML here quite yet!-->

<!--Sort of problematic, actually, that there doesn't appear to be a good BBCode to HTML transpiler. So I think the obvious solution is to add that to my compiler, instead of writing more. Insert XKCD here. :)-->

<!--The transpiler should probably convert BBCode to our Markdown superset (using comments like [[!]] for center, etc), then from that to HTML/BBCode.-->

<!--Temporary (read: probably permanent) hacky solution (May 11, 2020): Have added BBCode conversion to markdown templater. Sort of.-->

<!--Note: It actually works, which is impressive. TODO - Need to support [indent] tags. But it's readable. Sort of.-->

<!--oct 11 2020 - I did what??-->

<!--may 2021: lmao-->

<!--Also, this WYSIWYG markdown editor has a really nice colour/font for HTML comments. Cool! Where's the Vim support, though?-->

<!--november 2021: I guess I could just remove the indent tags in a postprocessor? shouldn't be that hard-->

<!--done. much more readable now. honestly, it looks pretty decent. I like the Times also.-->

<p class="content-paragraph"><b>Error: Page loading failed.</b></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>Why do I even bother?</i> </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas closed the tab, deftly switching his browser out of Villain Mode. Ever since the Simurgh had targeted every non-Comcast ISP, he hadn't been able to find a phone data plan that consistently worked. Although some people seemed to think this was a huge problem to Life As We Know It, Thomas had eventually decided that this had increased his productivity, allowing for far more time spent writing, drinking, and plotting not-evil-in-context schemes. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Or developing the convoluted contexts necessary for such plans.  </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">This was the only situation where he really couldn't stand it. Sitting on the bus, he didn't have anything to do, because his car had broken down <i>again</i>. Oh, did he miss the days of Japanese auto companies.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It had been three days since the disastrous 'distraction' that had been the bank robbery. He didn't miss the irony that the undertaking meant to distract the Protectorate from his actions had instead distracted him from the Protectorate's. In fact, this thought had kept him up at night, although that might have also been the pizza at work. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">For those past few days, he'd hardly done anything but the tasks Piggot had delegated to him. Soullessly, mindlessly, for once the true image of a PRT contractor. Yesterday afternoon, he'd even been given a raise.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It didn't matter. None of it mattered anymore.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">That first morning, Thomas had looked into all of his resources. Bank accounts, minions, even the Undersiders had been taken from him. <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i> had step-by-step guides for the first two, but not at the same time; without money, he wouldn't have a chance of finding well-trained employees - and without mercenaries, who would do the hard work of getting money in the first place?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He might have been abandoned, destitute, and (almost) out of options, but he wasn't going to the dirty work himself. Truly, society was biased against poor supervillains.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It was a strange experience, to be relying on this phenomenon he didn't understand. Before the attempted kidnapping, he hadn't really been confident that his conclusions were correct: it was far from a sure thing that activating his power was somehow placing him into alternate timelines. There were other potential explanations, like a drawn-out attack from a stranger, or... well, he couldn't really think of anything else, but just because the smartest man in the city couldn't think of an explanation, didn't mean that one didn't exist.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Now, however, he found himself <i>forced</i> to believe in his partially-unsubstantiated deduction. This had driven him to a new level of apathy: where before he had at least engaged in an illusion of reality, now he felt like his mind had fogged over, taking work and interacting with others on some form of autopilot. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas figured he'd wait until his fridge was empty, then merge the universes to use his power again. It wasn't like waiting could really <i>hurt</i> him. With some measure of luck, he was right, and he'd end up in a continuity where his past self had been successful, and all would be well once more. Like cheating, where failure could mean anything, but success could lead to an effortless solution to all his problems.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">As a consequence, he'd almost entirely stopped keeping track of the differences between realities. Barely collecting any information in either, he had mostly been using the split to ingest twice as much comfort food. That lack of effort had, seemingly naturally, led to the realities converging again, to the point where he hadn't noticed a single difference between them through the morning.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">That would, of course, change after he arrived at work. Thomas was more than knowledgeable about the butterfly effect; each tiny interaction he'd made with coworkers and acquaintances the last two days had spiralled into... well, he hadn't noticed much of a difference yesterday, but he was sure to see more changes today.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas made it in to the PRT Headquarters half an hour early. It was often necessary for him to leave so early; frequently his morning commute would be interrupted by some sort of superpowered throwdown, even as often as three or four times a week. He despised Brockton Bay's gangs. Ruining the city, really.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>Ding.</i> The elevator doors opened slowly, and he walked in, joining the grinning man who was already inside.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Heeey, buddy," Assault said, "Why the long face?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">The butterfly effect, Thomas mused, couldn't possibly exist. In both realities, Assault's voice was equally grating, although he was standing in slightly different positions within the elevator.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"I am contemplating the best method to dispose of your body," Thomas said in one reality. In the other: "The traffic in this city is horrible."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In both, Assault just laughed indistinguishably, patting Thomas on the back.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Infuriating.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It took far too long for the elevator to reach his floor. Unfortunately, Assault followed him off, prattling on about some inane topic (the ethics of the birdcage? who cared about <i>ethics</i>?). He wracked his brain for any reason that Assault would also need to be on this particular floor; unfortunately, the only office of note was Thomas'.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"So Assault, what can I do for you today?" Thomas asked in one reality, sitting peacefully behind his desk.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">In the other, he had already turned around and left the building. Mental health days were a new benefit, after all.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Well, I'm looking for information on our next job. If you get what I mean."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"No, actually, I- you're referring to the fake gang?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Yeah, it's getting boring, waiting at home," Assault said, leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"The master's already been contacted - didn't the director tell you?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Huh? What master?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas buried his head in his hands. "Don't you watch the news?"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Nah, it's too depressing. Some random cape's trial is coming up, and they're probably gonna be pushing for the birdcage... and it just makes me ask, how is that right? To imprison someone for life, with no possibility of extraction on innocence, especially considering the inaccuracy of our justice system. We really need to inspect our moral values as-"</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">"Get out of my office."</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><hr></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">When he wasn't working, or plotting his complete takeover of the city, Thomas also enjoyed the simple pleasures of life.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Many would call Brockton Bay a dump. The ones that wouldn't, likely had stronger words; unfortunately, Thomas couldn't consciously think them, as he had been working for several weeks on making his mind PG-compatible in anticipation of kidnapping that precognitive child.  </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It wouldn't do to have CPS come down on him, after all. He wasn't sure quite how that whole system worked, but he hadn't been willing to take any chances.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Regardless. Brockton Bay was, unfortunately, a very sub-par city. In fact, it had ranked top three on <i>McLane's Twenty Worst Places to Live in North America</i> five years in a row, with only Manitoba consistently doing worse.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">This was something he planned to eventually fix. He had long intended to do so by himself, hand-moulding the city into a peaceful, perfect eastern location. If that didn't work, then he'd been developing a backup plan, involving becoming the Butcher (his powerful psyche could resist any master effect) and leading the Teeth to become venture capitalist backers of up-and-coming businesses within the city.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">For now, however... he still had <i>this</i>. Standing on the roof of the PRT Headquarters, he could almost see to the nearest corner of the city. The afternoon sun shone through a thin layer of clouds, reflecting across the bay proper. He let it warm him, his suit jacket temporarily discarded. </p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Looking out across the city from this vantage point, taking it in from a comfortable distance, he could almost forget its flaws. Perhaps nature had a way of doing that, taking the edge off of humanity's worst creations.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Or maybe that was just the alcohol talking.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Sure, he technically wasn't supposed to drink on the job. But who really cared about technicalities? Certainly not paramilitary institutions.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas walked up to the edge of the roof, leaning on the railing. He hadn't spent that much time actually working, today. Instead of doing any of the paperwork Piggot had forwarded him, he'd found himself thinking about what he would do if the next use of his power didn't cause drastic changes to the temporal continuity.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It was, he figured, something he should have taken more precautions for earlier.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Visions of worse realities had also plagued his thoughts. In one, he imagined that Tattletale had somehow become <i>his</i> boss, and had (through force) compelled him to work for him, trapped creating new realities so she could practice her vulpine grin twice as much. He had shifted at one point to envisioning a continuity where Piggot had discovered his identity, and had therefore arranged to catapult him into Nilbog's city, leaving him to be tortured endlessly by mutated beings...</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">It was enough of a concern that he'd found it hard to focus on work. And so he'd come up here, pondering life and reality and the time-and-space continuum...</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">And then he'd closed his other reality, leaving him a singular man for the past thirty minutes.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas hadn't expected how sobering it would be, to be present in only one world for such a long time. He couldn't remember the last time he'd done this; hunting through his memory, it was possible that the last time he'd only existed in a single reality for more than ten contiguous minutes had been <i>before he got his powers.</i></p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Was that somehow linked to how much <i>realer</i> the world seemed now that he was perceiving it through only a single pair of eyes, viewing it with just one mind? How he no longer felt so distanced or unemotional as before? How he seemed to no longer be fully capable of the same logical, well-reasoned (if somewhat cruel) decisions?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Nah, that was probably the alcohol, too.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He stood on the precipice, metaphorical trigger just inches away from his even more metaphorical finger. Would everything shift again, when he activated his power? Would it all stay the same?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">He had no way of knowing, and that was as terrifying as it was thrilling.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Thomas took a deep breath -</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">And his hidden phone, slowly collecting lint in his shirt pocket, rang.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><i>What?</i> His criminal empire had been fully dismantled - or so he'd thought. Was there still someone out there, some minion he'd forgotten about, who hadn't heard the news? A loyal mercenary, checking in - or an unpaid one, demanding recompense?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Or was it Accord, realizing he'd been blocked on Thomas' work phone and phoning for the fourth time in three days to mock him for 'lowering the bar for PRT incompetence'?</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Some fatalistic feeling drove him to pull out the phone. He didn't even bother to check caller ID before accepting the call, placing the phone to his ear.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Someone spoke. Their voice sounded distant, weary, as if the speaker was barely managing the call before collapsing from exhaustion.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">They didn't say much.</p>

<p class="content-paragraph">Just four words, barely audible.</p>

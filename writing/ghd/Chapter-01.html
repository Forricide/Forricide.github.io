<p><i>Emotions whirling in the dark, in the putrid suffocating cold. A wet variety of hypothermic chill, bitterly disgusting; a cheimaphobe's nightmare.</i></p>

<p><i>The four metal walls press in oppressively; rust scrapes against skin, leaving deep impressions, dangerous marks.</i></p>

<p><i>Veritable pounds of compacted trash muffle the sounds that pound and reverberate through those impossibly high walls. It's still possible to make out barks of laughter and mocking tones; materialized malefice.</i></p>

<p><i>There's more than that - little touches, scratches everywhere. Bugs, so many bugs, crawling across skin; their little feet and tiny toes traverse pores like relatively gigantic Mars rovers.</i></p>

<p><i>Rusty nails, discarded in unassuming bags of waste, bite deep; they draw blood like sadistic nurses cosplaying a homeless Dracula.</i></p>

<p><i>Breathing deeper and deeper, about to crack; hopelessness finally sets in, like an iceberg into an olympic-class ocean liner.</i></p>

<p><i>An admittedly innocent black fly bites down, hungry.</i></p>

<p><i>That's when it happens.</i></p>

<p>"Perfect!" Thomas exclaimed, saving the document. <i>Power Generation Ideas #87</i> was his favourite yet. An excellent blend of your average potential trigger event (perhaps claustrophobia related) with the additional twist of some outside factors, he figured that this was more than enough material to work from. The overall concept of teenage drama, combined with his beautiful extended metaphor for stress, was rather juvenile - so it was exactly the sort of event he'd expect from the rabble that made up this pitiful planet's general population.</p>

<p>Staring off into space, he considered the various powers that might arise from #87's trigger setup. If taken literally, he could envision some trash-related perversion of tinkering or the like. That was a terrible idea, of course, but still something that could be explored in a longer story. Perhaps it could manifest as a misunderstood child with a newfound ability to cloak themselves in trash to augment their strength, pushing them towards being an outcast within socie-</p>

<p><i>Pffft.</i> Now that, that was starting to go a little too far for Thomas. There was only so much value in entertaining atrocious ideas like that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he could envision a figurative application of the trigger event's... stylistic qualities. Perhaps a breaker power, someone with the ability to swap between their forms as a mild-mannered teenager and a rusty locker at a moment's thought - or a 'small spaces' tinker, a parahuman that could come up with clever inventions that were only usable within a space of three square feet.</p>

<p>Perhaps he could take the prompt even farther - something unique, like a master power over bugs, fitting both the human isolation of the prompt and the... well, the bugs. It would be an unimpressive power, even more than the previous, but perhaps with some clever writing it could plausibly be presented as C-tier.</p>

<p>Ah, well. Expanding on these trigger ideas had never been his forte anyways. That was why these ideas always ended up on PHO, where Thomas liked to spend his free time, after some editing. </p>

<p>Maybe <b>XxVoid_CowboyxX</b> would be able to come up with a viable idea. Although the average internet forum user had an intellect that was only a pitiful fraction of Thomas', the great "Void Cowboy" (was that a clever name, or what?) was the exception that proved the rule. One of the more prodigious users of the power generation subforum, it was always a treat for Thomas to be blessed with a post by that particular savant.</p>

<p>Especially when it was Thomas himself providing some magnificent literature as fodder.</p>

<p><i>"Be my pet, be my pet..."</i></p>

<p><i>"Put my patronage to the test!"</i></p>

<p><i>"Tie my chain around your neck, chouchou..."</i></p>

<p>Ah, yes. Thomas's - well, actually, Coil's - favourite ringtone. He picked up the receiver, still typing idly with his other hand. It simply wouldn't do to give this particular caller too much of his (extremely valuable) attention.</p>

<p>"Coil here, wassup?"</p>

<p>Coil pronounced 'wassup' with a nice little <i>h</i> sound at the start. It gave the word a little bit of pizzazz, and just made him seem that much cooler. At least, that's what his mother had always told him.</p>

<p>Well, that was before she died, of course. Coil felt a few strings in his chest tighten, moderately close to his heart. Kidney strings. Those were difficult memories to stomach sometimes, that brutal reminder of the mortality of his own person, cruelly foreshadowed by the death of his entire family in a shocking spontaneous tea kettle combustion.</p>

<p>On the more positive side of things, the life insurance combined with a healthy inheritance had been more than enough to jump start his career. He was certain that his mother would be proud of him now, sitting in his own (custom designed!) desk in his own (high tech!) office, holding back his own (trademarked!) maniacal cackle at his own (absolutely perfect, and technically legal!) underground base, and listening to - er, ignoring - his very own minion.</p>

<p>Ah, right. His minion.</p>

<p>"-ably a Thinker, given the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Hey, Tattletale?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Coil?"</p>

<p>"What's your favourite kind of tea?"</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Coil closed the timeline. It was almost like she didn't want a high-quality tea collection gifted to her in a custom-made box with his name embossed on it. Go figure.</p>

<p>This is where it might be important to note that Thomas was not your ordinary supervillain. Aside from his sick mohawk and face that apparently looked like a certain popular actor, Thomas also had a brilliantly <i>awesome</i> superpower: he was able to split the universe in two, taking certain actions in one, and drinking excessive (well, according to his good-for-nothing physician, at least) quantities of hard liquor in the other.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this power could be underwhelming at times. Just a few months ago, he had been carefully executing a plan in his <i>timeline A</i> (that was A as in Alpha, the first letter in the Greek alphabet, and the first main self-descriptor on his Tinder profile) when - at a quite unfortunate point in time - his computer had bluescreened, losing him a solid hour's work on his current project. </p>

<p>Of course, Thomas was no fool. He'd been prepared for such an occurrence, and quickly saved the document in <i>timeline B</i> (that was B as in Booze, the first choice for a Friday evening, or Backup, something he should have done prior to updating that Oracle driver).</p>

<p>This, however, had left him with quite the dilemma. In Alpha, where his document had been lost to the computing aether, his plan was nearly complete. On the other hand, in Backup, the plan was just as complete as his Armsmaster/Oni Lee ship-fic, but he had saved those beautiful two-hundred perfectly chosen words completed in the current scene. He was forced to make a difficult choice: Acquire a potentially game-changing superhuman asset... or complete a brilliant dialogue between a smitten criminal and his stoic, justice-driven nemesis? </p>

<p>He'd known what he'd had to do, then. And thankfully, he'd still been able to... <i>recruit</i> that parahuman just a few weeks later. Only fourteen attempts in total - he'd made a little medal for his wall to commemorate that particular acquisition. ("This award presented to Coil by Thomas Calvert for not screwing up more than 15 times.")</p>

<p>In the end, that acquisition had come in useful several times already, and was probably just about to call him now. </p>

<p>Thankfully, the first time she'd called, it had been in Booze, so his two new timelines were both fresh, along with his mind. He picked up his vintage corded phone and pressed a quickdial button. </p>

<p>The ringtone only played for half a second. "I just-"</p>

<p>"So, Tattletale," he said, before she could complete her sentence.</p>

<p>A sigh. "Yes, Coil?"</p>

<p>"I heard you had some information for me."</p>

<p>"...I just phoned you. In fact, I left a message." On the other end, Coil could hear a faint groan, perhaps in disappointment at missing her first chance to speak with him. Her fault, really, for not timing her call correctly.</p>

<p>"My sources are, indeed, very reliable. But I'd still like to hear the information from you, if you would." </p>

<p>This statement, to the untrained eye (or, perhaps, ear) might have seemed innocuous. In truth, it was the exact opposite: a carefully laid, extraordinarily subtle implication that he would know any potential lies, that there was nothing she could hide from him. </p>

<p>Coil believed that it was important to keep his underlings in a constant state of slight fear. That made it harder for them to question him, and was also one of the first items in <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i>. He kept a hardcover copy in his desk. It was starting to fall apart, but he'd been using it less and less now that he had the majority of its contents memorized. He'd even successfully recommended it to Lung at one point, leading to a surge in power for the ABB, which would have been unfortunate if Coil hadn't received his $5 referral coupon. (To his disappointment, the follow-up book, <i>Conquering the Country for Dummies</i>, had been less than stellar. He suspected the author just wasn't experienced enough with the subject matter.)</p>

<p>"It's looking likely that there's been a trigger event at a local high school," Tattletale continued, "some place called... shit, I can't remember the name. Anyways, according to reports, a student was trapped in a locker for exactly three point one-four-one-five hours, before being released by the janitor. Apparently the locker was filled with some kind of biological waste, and my power has told me that they're a prime candidate for a Mas-"</p>

<p>"Seems unlikely," Coil said, politely cutting her off.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?"</p>

<p>"You say the locker was <i>filled with waste</i>, but also that there was a student trapped inside. How would that work, <i>hmmm</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, I mean-"</p>

<p>"Oh, unless you're attempting an analogy between trash, and the tragic victims of Brockton Bay's general socioeconomic condition, I suppose. Not a very flattering comparison, Tattletale. Quite unkind, in fact."</p>

<p>"Actually, I just-"</p>

<p>"Goodness, I think I'm going to have to see the lot of you go through sensitivity training. Just another expense for me to pay for, isn't that right, Tattletale?"</p>

<p>"That seems-"</p>

<p>"I can't even force you to pay for it, because <i>employer regulations</i> and <i>business ethics</i>. What an absolute shame, that I have to pay out of pocket for <i>your</i> rude and uncouth demeanour."</p>

<p>"You-"</p>

<p>He closed the timeline, having cleverly extracted all the information he could have possibly gained. Already in relaxation mode, he leaned back in his La-Z-Boy (recommended to him by a friend) and let out a deep and intensely thoughtful sigh.</p>

<p>So Tattletale thought that someone had 'probably' triggered at Winslow High. That meant, to his best estimate, that there was a solid five percent chance that such an event had occurred. One in twenty was something he was more than willing to gamble on, considering the way his innate cleverness (and, of course to a far lesser extent, his superpower) let him avoid risk.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, in a new timeline he played back the message his Tattletale had left for him, while taking a long sip of red wine.</p>

<p>"Coil. There's been an incident you should be aware of. A likely trigger event happened at Winslow High. They're suppressing it in the media, but it was pretty bad. I'll send you the details by email. If this person did trigger, my power tells me that they're probably a Shaker, given the circumstances. It might not be important, but I thought you would want to know."</p>

<p><i>Excellent.</i> Brockton Bay was a city with plenty of areas that would give a strategic advantage to almost any form of Shaker. If he wanted to make use of a funded parahuman gang in his more advanced plans, he'd need a parahuman that packed a punch - which Shakers frequently could - and the average student at a less economically privileged school like Winslow would be pitifully easy to recruit. He could almost <i>feel</i> his plans coming together. Well, in that ten-percent world where Tattletale wasn't barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<p>As he turned back to his game of online poker, Coil couldn't help but pay attention to a small feeling of unease. That little, nagging sensation that there was something he'd missed, something just a little bit off about the conversation (or lack thereof) he'd had with Tattletale. Something about the message she'd left, that just didn't seem right.</p>

<p>Oh well. He was sure it wasn't anything important.</p>

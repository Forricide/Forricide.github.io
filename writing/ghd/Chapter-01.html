<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Emotions whirling in the dark; a transcendental maelstrom in the putrid, suffocating cold. A wet variety of hypothermic chill, bitterly disgusting; the nightmare of a cheimaphobe.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>In the background, unseen - blotted out like a particularly malevolent Mandelbrot set, or a Rorschach test mutated beyond recognition - but not forgotten, four metal walls press in oppressively; rust scrapes against skin, leaving deep impressions, dangerous ferric-carmine marks.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Veritable pounds of compacted trash muffle the sounds that pound and reverberate through those impossibly high walls. It's still possible to make out barks of laughter and mocking tones; materialized malefice, maliciously manifested... metastasized monsters.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>There's more than that - little touches, scratches everywhere. Bugs, so many bugs, crawling across skin; an infestation of feeble feet and tiny toes traverse pores like relatively gigantic Mars rovers, the vast ocean of deep space separating them from Ground Control.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Rusty nails, discarded in unassuming bags of waste, bite deep; they draw blood like sadistic nurses cosplaying a homeless Dracula, were he a nail.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Breathing deeper and deeper, about to crack; hopelessness finally sinks in, like an iceberg into an olympic-class ocean liner. Once forging its maiden voyage into the inky-black sea, it is now carrying thousands to their grave, damaged yet uncaring, a dead oyster unknowingly depositing its prized pearl into the hands of a killer.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>An admittedly innocent black fly bites down. Hungry, unashamed, living its best (but tragically brief) life.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>That's when it happens.</i></p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">"Excellent!" Thomas exclaimed, saving the document with a flourishing <i>ctrl-s</i>. He gave himself a little pat on the back - figuratively, of course: writing was far too draining to do physical exercise immediately after.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Power Generation Ideas #87</i> was his favourite yet. It was a masterful blend of your average potential trigger event (perhaps sparked from claustrophobia) and that extra spark of creative brilliance that Thomas brought to the table. Combined with the additional twist of some unique outside factors, he was certain that this prompt was more than enough material to work from. The overall concept of teenage drama, combined with his beautiful extended metaphor for stress, was rather juvenile - so it was exactly the sort of incident he'd expect from the rabble that made up this pitiful planet's general population.</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>In a world where superpowers are the norm, literary fiction is truly the only realism,</i> mused Thomas.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">Staring off into space, he considered the various powers that might arise from #87's trigger setup. If taken literally, Thomas could envision some trash-related perversion of tinkering or the like. That was a terrible idea, of course, but still something that could be explored in a longer story. A character who could improve upon trash, or only make inventions that <i>were</i> trash-</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, that already described Leet, didn't it? He wouldn't want to be unoriginal.</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph">On the other hand, he could envision a figurative application of the trigger event's more... stylistic qualities. Perhaps a breaker power, someone with the ability to swap between their forms as a mild-mannered teenager (making use of the literary device <i>oxymoron</i>, of course) and a rusty locker at a moment's thought - or a 'small spaces' tinker, a parahuman that could come up with clever inventions that were only usable within an enclosed space of three square feet.</p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Perhaps he could take the prompt even further - something more unique, like a master power over bugs, a ghastly idea that fit both the human isolation of the prompt and the... well, the bugs. It would be an unimpressive power, even more than the others he'd considered, but perhaps with some clever writing it could plausibly be presented as C-tier.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, well. Expanding on these trigger ideas had never been his forte anyways. That was why these prompts (well, their lightly edited counterparts, at least; he'd have to sprinkle in a few adjectives later for flair) always ended up on PHO, the internet forum where Thomas liked to spend his free time.</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">Maybe the forum-goer <b>XxVoid_CowboyxX</b> would be able to come up with a viable idea. Although the average forum user was possessed of intellect only a pitiful fraction of Thomas', the great "Void Cowboy" (was that a clever name, or what?) was the exception that proved the rule. One of the more prodigious users of the power generation subforum, it was always a treat for Thomas to be blessed with a post by that particular savant.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">Especially when it was Thomas himself providing some magnificent literature as fodder.</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Be my pet, be my pet..."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Put my patronage to the test!"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Tie my chain around your neck, chouchou..."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, yes. Thomas' - well, actually, <i>Coil</i>'s - favourite ringtone.</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">At this juncture, it may be prudent to mention that Thomas was not merely a <i>literary</i> mastermind. Although writing was a long-lived passion of his, he doubted it would ever be sufficient to finance his other activities. He was, after all, also a mastermind in a slightly more evil sense. (The dense reader, possibly bereft of a capability to infer even the slightest detail, may appreciate the clarification that he was a <i>criminal</i> mastermind, and a rather successful one at that)</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Thomas (currently known as Coil even to his internal monologue) picked up the receiver, still typing idly with his other hand. It simply wouldn't do to give this particular caller too much of his (extremely valuable) attention. Besides, there were prompts to be written.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"Coil here, wassup?"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil pronounced 'wassup' with a nice little <i>h</i> sound at the start. It gave the word a little bit of pizzazz, and just made him seem that much cooler. At least, that's what his mother had always told him.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">That had been before she died, of course. Coil felt a few strings in his chest tighten, moderately close to his heart. Kidney strings. Those were difficult memories to stomach sometimes, that brutal reminder of the mortality of his own person, cruelly foreshadowed by the death of his entire family in a spontaneous tea kettle combustion.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">As a bit of a silver lining, the life insurance combined with a healthy inheritance had been more than enough to jump start his career. He was certain that his mother would be proud of him now, sitting at his own (custom designed!) desk in his own (high tech!) office, holding back his own (trademarked!) maniacal cackle at his own (absolutely perfect, and technically legal!) underground base, and listening to - er, ignoring - his very own minion.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, right. His minion.</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"-ably a Thinker, given the circumstances."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">"Tattletale."</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Uh - yes?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">"What's your favourite tea?"</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"..."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">It was almost like she didn't want a high-quality tea collection gifted to her in a custom-made box with his name embossed on it. Go figure; he'd used that as a gift before, and the recipients had definitely had a blast. Shaking his head, Coil collapsed that reality. </p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">This is where it might become important to note that Thomas was not your ordinary supervillain, if indeed there was such a thing. (If one were to meet Thomas without even recognizing his supervillainy, well... that was really on them) Aside from his sick mohawk and face that apparently resembled a certain popular actor, Thomas also had a brilliantly <i>awesome</i> superpower: he was able to split the entire universe in two, taking certain actions in one version, and drinking excessive (well, according to his latest good-for-nothing physician, at least) quantities of hard liquor in the other. Then, at any point he desired, he could discard one universe, choosing the other to become enshrined in reality, and start the process all over again.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">Admittedly, this power could be underwhelming at times. Just a few months ago, he had been carefully executing a plan in his <i>reality A</i> (that was A as in <i>Alpha</i>, the first letter of the Greek alphabet and the first self-descriptor on his Tinder profile) when - at a quite unfortunate point in time - his computer had bluescreened, losing him a solid hour's work on his current project. </p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">Of course, Thomas was no fool. He'd been prepared for such an occurrence, and quickly saved the very same document in <i>reality B</i> (that was B as in Booze, the first choice for a Friday evening, or Backup, something he should have done prior to updating that Oracle driver).</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">This, however, had left him with quite the dilemma. In Alpha, where his document had been lost to the computing aether, his real-world plan was nearly complete. On the other hand, in Backup, the plan was just as complete as his Armsmaster/Oni Lee ship-fic, but he had saved those beautiful two-hundred perfectly chosen words completed in the current scene. </p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">He had been forced to make a difficult choice: Acquire a potentially game-changing superhuman asset... or complete a brilliant dialogue between a smitten criminal and his stoic, justice-driven nemesis? </p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd known what he'd had to do, then. And thankfully, he'd still been able to... <i>recruit</i> that particular parahuman just a few weeks later. Only fourteen attempts in total - he'd made a little medal for his wall to commemorate that frustrating acquisition. ("This award presented to Coil by acclaimed PRT consultant Thomas Calvert for not screwing up more than 15 times.")</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">In the end, that <i>acquisition</i> had come in useful several times already, and was probably just about to call him now. </p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Thankfully, the first time she'd called, it had been in Booze, so the two realities he now co-existed in were both fresh, along with his mind. He picked up his vintage corded phone and pressed a quick-dial button labelled "irritating". </p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">The ringtone only played for half a second. <i>"I just-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">"So, Tattletale," he said, before she could complete her sentence. Crisp, this time, and finely enunciated. Whatever else Coil was, he was certainly a professional.</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">A sigh. <i>"Yes, Coil?"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">"I heard you had some information for me."</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"...I just phoned you. In fact, I left a message."</i> On the other end, Coil could hear a faint groan, perhaps in disappointment at missing her first chance to speak with him. Her fault, really, for not timing her call correctly. He hadn't even noticed that she'd called, in this reality. <i>Good</i> minions knew to get into contact when he was paying attention.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">"My sources are, indeed, very reliable. But I'd still like to hear the information from you, if you would." </p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">This statement, to the untrained eye (or, perhaps, ear) might have seemed innocuous. In truth, it was the exact opposite: a carefully laid, extraordinarily subtle implication that he held all the cards. With the information available to him through his myriad sources, any lies would be as clear as water. There was nothing she could hide from him!</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil believed that it was important to keep his underlings in a constant state of slight, uncomfortable fear. That made it harder for them to question him, and was also one of the first items in <i>Being a Supervillain for Dummies</i>. He kept a hardcover copy in his desk. It was starting to fall apart, but he'd been using it less and less now that he had the majority of its contents memorized. He'd even successfully recommended it to the local gang leader Lung at one point, leading to a surge in power for his gang, which would have been unfortunate if Coil hadn't received his $5 referral coupon. (To his disappointment, the follow-up book, <i>Conquering the Country for Dummies</i>, had been less than stellar. He suspected the author just wasn't experienced enough with the subject matter.)</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"I've discovered a possible candidate for a trigger event at a local high school,"</i> Tattletale continued, <i>"some place called... shit, I can't remember the name. Windmill? Wallow? I'm sure it started with a W. Anyways, according to reports, a student was trapped in a locker for exactly three point one-four-one-five hours, before being released by the janitor. Apparently the locker was filled with some kind of biological waste, and my power indicates that they're a prime candidate for a Stran-"</i></p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">"Seems unlikely," Coil said, politely cutting her off.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">"Excuse me?"</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">"You say the locker was <i>filled with waste</i>, but also that there was a student trapped inside. How would that work, <i>hmmm</i>?"</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">"Well, I mean-"</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">"Oh, unless you're attempting an analogy between trash, and the tragic victims of Brockton Bay's general socioeconomic condition, I suppose. Not a very flattering comparison, Tattletale. Quite unkind, in fact. Cruel, even."</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"Actually, I just-"</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">"Goodness, I think I'm going to have to see the lot of you go through sensitivity training. Just another expense for me to pay for, isn't that right, Tattletale? Another responsibility you've heaped onto my plate."</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">"That seems-"</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">"I can't even force you to pay for it, because <i>employer regulations</i> and <i>business ethics</i>. What an absolute shame, that I have to pay out of pocket to fix <i>your</i> rude and uncouth demeanour. Employers truly have no rights in this country. What's next, minion unions?"</p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">"You-"</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">He closed the reality, having cleverly extracted all the information he could have possibly stood to gain - and narrowly averting the disaster that would be a subcontracted unionized supervillain team. Already in relaxation mode, he leaned back in his La-Z-Boy (recommended to him by a friend) and let out a deep and intensely thoughtful sigh.</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">Tattletale thought that someone had 'possibly' triggered at some local high school. That meant, to Thomas' best estimate, that there was a solid five percent chance that such an event had actually occurred. One in twenty was something he was more than willing to gamble on, considering the way his innate cleverness (and, of course to a far lesser extent, his superpower) let him avoid taking risks.</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">Out of curiosity, in a fresh reality he played back the message Tattletale had left for him, while partaking in a long sip of red wine.</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>"Coil. There's been an incident you should be aware of. A potential trigger event happened at Winslow High. They're suppressing it in the media, but it was pretty bad. I'll send you the details by email. If this person did trigger, my power tells me that they're probably a Shaker, given the circumstances. It might not be important, but I thought you would want to know."</i></p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Excellent.</i> Brockton Bay was a city with plenty of areas that would give a strategic advantage to almost any form of Shaker. If he wanted to make use of a funded parahuman gang in his more advanced plans, he'd need a member that packed a punch - which Shakers frequently could - and the average student at a less economically privileged school like Winslow would be pitifully easy to recruit. He could almost <i>feel</i> his plans coming together. Well, in that ten-percent world where Tattletale wasn't barking up the wrong tree.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">As he turned back to his game of online poker, Coil couldn't help but notice a small feeling of unease. That little, nagging sensation that there was something he'd missed, something just a little bit off about the conversation (or lack thereof) he'd had with Tattletale. Something about the message she'd left, that just didn't seem right.</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">Oh well. He was sure it wasn't anything important.</p></a><p><b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="Chapter-02.html">Next</a></b></p>

<p>Today, Coil met his team of supervillains.</p>

<p>Wait, no, that was wrong. Today, <i>Thomas Calvert</i> met his team of parahumans. Because, of course, this wasn't a group that his preferred persona had prepared. Rather, this... cape collection had been <i>forced</i> on him. Mere words could not even hope to express his disgust at this eventuality.</p>

<p><i>Calm down, Thomas. You just need to manage this long enough to hear back from Brittage. Just... that... lo-</i></p>

<p>"Heeey! You must be, ah, <i>Cowvert</i>? Green cow? Something like that, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Ah yes, that deep, gravelly, and unbelievably irratating voice. In the past, he had used timelines with <i>extreme</i> prejudice to avoid working with this man. Of course, his name had been the first on Piggot's list. Such was the nature of the cruel, ever-targeted hand of fate.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Assault."</p>

<p>The man in question grinned, shaking his head. "No, no, monsieur. You can call me... <i>Le Voleur</i>! For I am the - er, ze thief in ze night!"</p>

<p>"Take a seat, Assault."</p>

<p>Now that his team was fully assembled, Thomas took a moment to survey them. Not really what he would have called a <i>team</i>, although he wasn't going to say that out loud. He'd been given part-time management of Dauntless and Velocity, apparently Aegis had volunteered for experience, and of course Assault was there for "as long as he needed". </p>

<p>A group of mediocre heroes, and he had to make them - what, <i>acceptable target villains</i>? He'd sent a few emails, ten texts, and a set of nicely-packaged letters to Piggot asking for some kind of clarifaction, but had yet to hear back. Unsurprisingly, his pleading voicemail hadn't managed to elicit a response, either.</p>

<p>"I'm guessing you're wondering why I've called you all here today," Thomas said, finally breaking out of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I heard there were things I could break without it coming out of my pay," Assault said.</p>

<p>"The Director told me that if I participated in this, I might get a raise up to minimum wage," added Velocity.</p>

<p>"This counts as community service, right?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>Thomas put down his phone. "Ah, I think I caught all of that. Sounds good. Dauntless. Why don't you explain what this little group is for?"</p>

<p>"For sure! So, this is all the result of an <i>amazing</i> idea that the Director and, um..."</p>

<p>"Call me Thomas."</p>

<p>"Thomas, here, had. An idea they had. A great idea! Yes, right. So, as you probably know, there's a new master cape in the city! And they're really, really strong. So we're forming this honeypot supervillain team, hoping that they target us, and then using that to get in contact with the master themselves!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be easier to just put out a bulletin asking this supposedly-heroic cape to contact us?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>Assault shook his head. "That wouldn't get you service hours, kid. And it would be low risk - or, in other words, low fun."</p>

<p>Velocity nodded sagely. This was his area of expertise. "I've been doing investigation duties since I started working for the Protectorate. They'd have fired me long ago if it wasn't for that particular source of billable hours. I don't even need to worry about getting too good at it, because there's this one kid named "Browbeat" that I just can't ever find."</p>

<p>"So, Thomas. How are you planning to kick this off? Maybe we go sell some drugs, beat up some kids, something like that?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of executing a plan I've had for a while, to rob a bank."</p>

<p>"A plan... you've had for a while?" asked Aegis.</p>

<p>"Oh, er," Thomas said, "just in case this exact scenario happened. I like to plan ahead."</p>

<p>"Very clever," said Velocity. "But you might be working too hard. Have you heard of using work hours to plan your vacations, instead? It's quite pleasant."</p>

<p>He picked up the phone.</p>

<p>Four words, barely audible.</p>

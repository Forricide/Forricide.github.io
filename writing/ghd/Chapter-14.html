<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">In the bathroom, Coil straightened his suit. Whatever that meant; for all its faults, latex was appreciably form-fitting.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">The Undersiders would be crashing the fundraiser in ten minutes, which mean he still had time to practice his lines. In one reality, he donned a hoodie and went to go scope out the venue; in the other, he began:</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">"Hello, denizens of Brockton-"</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">With a start, Coil realized he didn't know the difference between denizens and citizens, and had to pull out his phone.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">A moment later, he put it away, satisfied, and having completely lost his train of thought.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">"Brockton Bay. It is I, Coil, the voice in the shadows, the eyes in the skies, the ears in the trees, the mouth in the- well, wherever a mouth would be to gain secret information. Suffice it to say, I am all powerful and all knowing."</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Not exactly true, but as his father had always said, "the truth is elastic insofar as you can stretch it".</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"You may not have heard of me. That is to say, I am expressly forbidding you from having heard of me. I have, after all, been controlling this city from the <i>shadows</i>. I have been doing so for weeks. Months, even. A year, if you want to be generous."</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil imagined shocked gasps from his audience. The fear, the horror. The child at table 8 wetting their pants.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes. What you're thinking right now is correct. I have, in fact, already won. And I am here today to reveal to you <i>just how much</i> you have lost."</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">At this point, his notes indicated the audience would most likely fall silent, awaiting his next word like a sword of Damocles. If it were a sword, that is, and not a word, which was an instance where one letter made a fair amount of difference.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">"Firstly, I am in control of not just the Undersiders, but also the Travelers. If you're unfamiliar with that gang, I can assure you they are very dangerous; I've taken the responsibility of updating their wiki pages, but please read those <i>after</i> I've finished speaking. For now, an appropriate level of fear to that announcement is approximately an eight out of ten, although you're welcome to pretend to have also learned about Noelle, which would raise that to a ten."</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">At this point, the wiser members of his audience would begin to display the characteristic traits of someone in a state of ten out of ten points of fear. Coil's notes on the matter read as follows:</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>screaming, hitting their tables, frantically drinking alcohol, jumping in circles, crying</i></p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil himself had never been afraid of anything. Fortunately, after reading several articles on the matter, he was confident in being a subject matter expert.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">After the (imaginary) audience had stopped crying (according to a recent study, the average duration of a crying session was 8 minutes; Coil figured threats of being mauled by gigantic dogs could help speed that up), Coil continued: "I understand your fear. But I have good news for you, for the weak and subordinate population of Brockton Bay. I am a benevolent underground supervillain leader. I will not require you to sacrifice your children to me or to cut out vital organs in a display of piety. Instead, I will focus my efforts on improving the Bay."</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">A hush fell over the audience, if the audience was a mirror, and a hush was a bit of spittle from Coil's over-exuberant speech.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">"Mommy?"</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil's head snapped to the side.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"There's a strange snake man in the washroom," a boy said.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"Tommy," came a voice from outside the washroom, gently: "I know you like your imaginary friends, but if you don't need to go, you can just say that."</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">The boy stood silently for a moment, then turned around. As the door closed behind him, Coil heard him say: "I don't want to go anymore."</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Peace and quiet. Now, where was he?</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Behind Coil, a stall door creaked open.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil paused.</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">Armsmaster stepped out.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil closed the reality.</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">This was fine. In the other one, he was standing at a table, repeatedly pretending to pour himself punch. It was working so far; nobody had come up to talk to him, and presumably none of the other attendees had spotted the Coil suit underneath his hood.</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-13.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

<a name="pg1"><p class="content-paragraph">In the bathroom, Coil straightened his suit. Whatever that meant; for all its faults, latex was appreciably form-fitting.</p></a>

<a name="pg2"><p class="content-paragraph">The Undersiders would be crashing the fundraiser in ten minutes, which mean he still had time to practice his lines. In one reality, he donned a hoodie and went to go scope out the venue; in the other, he began:</p></a>

<a name="pg3"><p class="content-paragraph">"Hello, denizens of Brockton-"</p></a>

<a name="pg4"><p class="content-paragraph">With a start, Coil realized he didn't know the difference between denizens and citizens, and had to pull out his phone.</p></a>

<a name="pg5"><p class="content-paragraph">A moment later, he put it away, satisfied, and having completely lost his train of thought.</p></a>

<a name="pg6"><p class="content-paragraph">"Brockton Bay. It is I, Coil, the voice in the shadows, the eyes in the skies, the ears in the trees, the mouth in the- well, wherever a mouth would be to gain secret information. Suffice it to say, I am all powerful and all knowing."</p></a>

<a name="pg7"><p class="content-paragraph">Not exactly true, but as his father had always said, "the truth is elastic insofar as you can stretch it".</p></a>

<a name="pg8"><p class="content-paragraph">"You may not have heard of me. That is to say, I am expressly forbidding you from having heard of me. I have, after all, been controlling this city from the <i>shadows</i>. I have been doing so for weeks. Months, even. A year, if you want to be generous."</p></a>

<a name="pg9"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil imagined shocked gasps from his audience. The fear, the horror. The child at table 8 wetting their pants.</p></a>

<a name="pg10"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes. What you're thinking right now is correct. I have, in fact, already won. And I am here today to reveal to you <i>just how much</i> you have lost."</p></a>

<a name="pg11"><p class="content-paragraph">At this point, his notes indicated the audience would most likely fall silent, awaiting his next word like a sword of Damocles. If it were a sword, that is, and not a word, which was an instance where one letter made a fair amount of difference.</p></a>

<a name="pg12"><p class="content-paragraph">"Firstly, I am in control of not just the Undersiders, but also the Travelers. If you're unfamiliar with that gang, I can assure you they are very dangerous; I've taken the responsibility of updating their wiki pages, but please read those <i>after</i> I've finished speaking. For now, an appropriate level of fear to that announcement is approximately an eight out of ten, although you're welcome to pretend to have also learned about Noelle, which would raise that to a ten."</p></a>

<a name="pg13"><p class="content-paragraph">At this point, the wiser members of his audience would begin to display the characteristic traits of someone in a state of ten out of ten points of fear. Coil's notes on the matter read as follows:</p></a>

<a name="pg14"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>screaming, hitting their tables, frantically drinking alcohol, jumping in circles, crying</i></p></a>

<a name="pg15"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil himself had never been afraid of anything. Fortunately, after reading several articles on the matter, he was confident in being a subject matter expert.</p></a>

<a name="pg16"><p class="content-paragraph">After the (imaginary) audience had stopped crying (according to a recent study, the average duration of a crying session was 8 minutes; Coil figured threats of being mauled by gigantic dogs could help speed that up), Coil continued: "I understand your fear. But I have good news for you, for the weak and subordinate population of Brockton Bay. I am a benevolent underground supervillain leader. I will not require you to sacrifice your children to me or to cut out vital organs in a display of piety. Instead, I will focus my efforts on improving the Bay."</p></a>

<a name="pg17"><p class="content-paragraph">A hush fell over the audience, if the audience was a mirror, and a hush was a bit of spittle from Coil's over-exuberant speech.</p></a>

<a name="pg18"><p class="content-paragraph">"Mommy?"</p></a>

<a name="pg19"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil's head snapped to the side.</p></a>

<a name="pg20"><p class="content-paragraph">"There's a strange snake man in the washroom," a boy said.</p></a>

<a name="pg21"><p class="content-paragraph">"Tommy," came a voice from outside the washroom, gently: "I know you like your imaginary friends, but if you don't need to go, you can just say that."</p></a>

<a name="pg22"><p class="content-paragraph">The boy stood silently for a moment, then turned around. As the door closed behind him, Coil heard him say: "I don't want to go anymore."</p></a>

<a name="pg23"><p class="content-paragraph">Peace and quiet. Now, where was he?</p></a>

<a name="pg24"><p class="content-paragraph">Ah, yes. The audience was a mirror, and Coil was his own reflection; a continued soliloquy was in order.</p></a>

<a name="pg25"><p class="content-paragraph">"I will raise this city up from the trash from whence its population came, and employ my sublime intelligence to bring order! My first order - which you would all do well to follow this very evening - will be to eliminate bottled water. It's <i>horrifically</i> bad for the environment. You will take this step, and together, we will walk proudly forward into a world free of micro-plastics!"</p></a>

<a name="pg26"><p class="content-paragraph">In Coil's imagination, the crowd - except for a few overwhelmed, sobbing individuals - began to applaud. This applause lasted for exactly three seconds, as Coil would have desired it.</p></a>

<a name="pg27"><p class="content-paragraph">"My second order! All citizens of Brockton Bay will be required to..."</p></a>

<a name="pg28"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil trailed off.</p></a>

<a name="pg29"><p class="content-paragraph">At this point, his notes read:</p></a>

<a name="pg30"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>todo - come up with suitably evil order for peons</i></p></a>

<a name="pg31"><p class="content-paragraph">That was hardly going to work. The Undersiders would be arriving in (he checked his watch) four minutes, and he needed to practice <i>something</i>. Coil looked around the washroom for ideas; unfortunately, it was a rather bland area, due to being a washroom.</p></a>

<a name="pg32"><p class="content-paragraph">He heard someone break off a strip of toilet paper from within a stall.</p></a>

<a name="pg33"><p class="content-paragraph">That's when the idea came to him:</p></a>

<a name="pg34"><p class="content-paragraph">Bidets.</p></a>

<a name="pg35"><p class="content-paragraph">"Yes, my second order!" Coil continued with renewed enthusiasm. "All toilets in the city will be fitted with bidets. They are the environmentally friendly solution, after all."</p></a>

<a name="pg36"><p class="content-paragraph">The crowd roared, applause threatening to shatter the mirror. Well, presumably there weren't many mirrors in the banquet hall; Coil supposed they'd be shattering the windows instead.</p></a>

<a name="pg37"><p class="content-paragraph">"And my final order!" The second was filler, really; everything important came in threes. "Complete eradication of the Protectorate and PRT, as their employees will serve only me!"</p></a>

<a name="pg38"><p class="content-paragraph">In his mind, the crowd went wild, already imagining the fantastic changes that would come to the city with Coil in power.</p></a>

<a name="pg39"><p class="content-paragraph">Behind Coil, a stall door creaked open.</p></a>

<a name="pg40"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil turned around.</p></a>

<a name="pg41"><p class="content-paragraph">Armsmaster stepped out, famed halberd in hand.</p></a>

<a name="pg42"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil started: "Would you like to submit to my power now? I can promise you-"</p></a>

<a name="pg43"><p class="content-paragraph">Armsmaster tased him.</p></a>

<a name="pg44"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil closed the reality.</p></a>

<a name="pg45"><p class="content-paragraph">This was fine. In the other reality, he was standing at a table in the banquet hall, repeatedly pretending to pour himself punch. It was working so far; nobody had come up to talk to him, and presumably none of the other attendees had spotted the Coil suit underneath his hood.</p></a>

<a name="pg46"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd had his practice. The Undersiders would arrive within moments, and he would be free to perform his monologue.</p></a>

<a name="pg47"><p class="content-paragraph">Before using his power again, of course. Even managing the Travelers for the past two weeks had been an incredible hassle; he wanted out as soon as possible. Who asked for <i>seven tonnes</i> of roast ham for dinner? He was going to go bankrupt just off of the food, and that wasn't even including the literal eldritch horror in his basement!</p></a>

<a name="pg48"><p class="content-paragraph">An explosion of glass caught Coil's attention. He spun around, already taking off his hood. Nobody in the hall noticed him. Every single person was transfixed on the group of monster-riding capes that had descended through the now-destroyed glass ceiling.</p></a>

<a name="pg49"><p class="content-paragraph">The floor shook as a final dog-monster-<i>thing</i> dropped from a hole in the roof. A small shard of glass hit the table beside Coil, and he was suddenly aware in a much realer sense of the risk he was taking right now. If he died before using his power...</p></a>

<a name="pg50"><p class="content-paragraph">That wouldn't happen.</p></a>

<a name="pg51"><p class="content-paragraph">"Everyone stop moving, if you don't want to get hurt!"</p></a>

<a name="pg52"><p class="content-paragraph">The heroic capes in attendance seemed to ignore this, for some reason.</p></a>

<a name="pg53"><p class="content-paragraph">"All right, you're on, Coil!" shouted Tattletale, gesturing. The attendees turned their heads, perhaps more from confusion than persuasion.</p></a>

<a name="pg54"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil raised a small voice amplifier to his mouth. The practice had left him with a <i>slight</i> rasp, but he was sure it wouldn't be noticeable.</p></a>

<a name="pg55"><p class="content-paragraph">He was sure the Undersiders would be able to distract the Protectorate for the five minutes he needed for his monologue.</p></a>

<a name="pg56"><p class="content-paragraph">"Brockton Bay! It is I, Coil, the voice in the shadows-"</p></a>

<a name="pg57"><p class="content-paragraph">"Who the heck is Coil?" someone shouted.</p></a>

<a name="pg58"><p class="content-paragraph">"-the eyes in the skies... the ears in-"</p></a>

<a name="pg59"><p class="content-paragraph">A half-eaten loaf of bread bounced off his chest. Someone shouted: "Most of the voices are in the shadows, it's Brockton Bay, snake-for-brains!"</p></a>

<a name="pg60"><p class="content-paragraph">Coil paused and took a moment to center himself. Miss Militia and Armsmaster were on the other side of the hall, chasing Bitch, who was in turn chasing Gallant.</p></a>

<a name="pg61"><p class="content-paragraph">Someone threw a stick of butter at Coil, but missed, and it fell into the punch bowl with a disappointing <i>plop</i>.</p></a>

<a name="pg62"><p class="content-paragraph">He'd have to skip ahead if he wanted to get anywhere.</p></a>

<a name="pg63"><p class="content-paragraph">"I have been controlling this city from the shadows! I have been doing so for <i>years</i>!"</p></a>

<a name="pg64"><p class="content-paragraph">"Then you've been totally useless!" someone shouted. "Ever tried controlling Lung?"</p></a>

<a name="pg65"><p class="content-paragraph">"The point is! I have, in fact, already won! And I am here today to reveal to you <i>just how much</i> you have lost!"</p></a>

<a name="pg66"><p class="content-paragraph">A butter knife flipped through the air and bounced unceremoniously off his forehead.</p></a>

<a name="pg67"><p class="content-paragraph"><i>Ouch</i>, thought Coil. Fortunately, brevity was the soul of wit, and Coil was nothing if not witty. And intelligent, of course, but that didn't need to be said.</p></a>

<a name="pg68"><p class="content-paragraph">"I am here today to give you my three orders! I have chosen a small set of items, that should be easy for your feeble minds to remember!"</p></a>

<a name="pg69"><p class="content-paragraph">A tomato splattered across his left leg.</p></a>

<a name="pg70"><p class="content-paragraph">"Firstly, I will eliminate bottled water! Under my orders, you will cast off the plasticky chains of your unenvironmental subjugation and become the first city in a world where reusable water bottles are the norm!"</p></a>

<a name="pg71"><p class="content-paragraph">Shadow Stalker, who'd been saying something about how she was going to put a bolt through his head if he didn't stop talking, paused.</p></a>

<a name="pg72"><p class="content-paragraph">A few people looked around in confusion.</p></a>

<a name="pg73"><p class="content-paragraph">Assault gave him a thumbs-up from where he was sitting.</p></a>

<a name="pg74"><p class="content-paragraph">Not quite the reaction Coil had been hoping for. He did suppose the first two orders weren't exactly supervillain material; they were buildup for the third, more important order. Oh well, nobody would be laughing at him after that.</p></a>

<a name="pg75"><p class="content-paragraph">He raised a hand to continue, then was promptly tased by Velocity.</p></a>

<a name="pg76"><p class="content-paragraph">The last thing he heard before losing consciousness was:</p></a>

<a name="pg77"><p class="content-paragraph">"What? If we ban plastic water bottles, what will I get out of going to meetings?"</p></a><p><b><a href="Chapter-13.html">Previous</a></b> <b>|</b> <b><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></b></p>

<p>Thomas was having a very bad day.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure when, exactly, it had started. Was it ten minutes ago, when he had received a phone call from one of his subordinates? Or this morning, when he'd woken up? Or, was it at exactly oh-zero hours, by virtue of that being when the day had actually started?</p>

<p>No, wait, that last one was wrong. He was taking things too literally again. He didn't want to have to make another appointment with his psychologist. <i>Breathe, Calvert. Just breathe. Everything will be all right.</i></p>

<p>Everything was not all right. </p>

<p>It was hard to say what he'd done wrong. Sure, he'd had the Undersiders (that brutish group of petty criminals he did his best to avoid associating with) raid a casino, a few weeks back. It hadn't been a bad idea - anyone would agree! Robbing a casino made for a great criminal debut, and if you were clever with choosing your target, it always made working relationships with the IRS a little smoother.</p>

<p>Had he expected the casino attack to piss off Lung, that local thug, gang leader, and respiratory system aficionado? </p>

<p>Well, no. </p>

<p><i>Thomas, wasn't that casino in the middle of ABB territory?</i> you ask, referring to a fact-checking wiki page you keep open in a pinned tab.</p>

<p>That was true. And, admittedly, Thomas <i>knew</i> he should have seen this coming. He'd just been so focused on finding a good ex-military mercenary to teach a sensitivity training class, that he'd barely considered saving a timeline for its prospective students. If he'd managed to keep Booze, his second timeline, up for a little longer, he might have found out that the most powerful parahuman in the entire city was hunting his patron gang. As it was, an unfortunate (but, in retrospect, quite predictable) bout of kidney failure had led to him closing Booze, leaving him with only the timeline where he had never ingested a single pint. </p>

<p>But also the timeline where a fire-breathing immortal dragon was hunting three minions that had a particular use to his plans, and one more minion that was practically vital.</p>

<p>As it was, he wasn't sure if he'd made the wrong decision. He did know someone living with kidney failure, and he didn't envy them.</p>

<p>Well, actually, he did, just a little. But that didn't really have anything to do with the kidney failure.</p>

<p>However, now he was living with consequences that felt almost equally bad for his health. The Undersiders, a gang he'd brought together virtually through his own willpower (and large amounts of illicit money) were likely going to die today. </p>

<p>In both of his timelines, Lung was on a warpath. The cape was an unstoppable force - at least, Thomas certainly didn't have any countermeasures to a half-dragon on a rampage. All he could do was attempt to use his power from a distance to shift the odds away from <i>Lung destroys everything, including Thomas' hopes and dreams</i>.</p>

<p>And he'd certainly have to play a heavy part in fate today, if he wanted to keep any of his minions.</p>

<p>Yes, this called for pulling out all the stops.</p>

<p>Timeline Alpha was abandoned. He'd asked the Undersiders (through his liaison, the ever-frustrating Tattletale) to attempt an ambush on Lung.</p>

<p>This had not gone well.</p>

<p>He split fate again. It was time to go all-out. In one timeline, he pulled open the left drawer of his desk; the other, the right.</p>

<p>A can of some off-brand crap for timeline Beer.</p>

<p>But for timeline Alcohol, only the finest red wine would do.</p>

<p>In one, he phoned Tattletale, only slightly intoxicated.</p>

<p><i>"What's up, boss?"</i></p>

<p>"I need you to - urp - instruct the other Undersiders to circle back. I think Oni Lee is watching you."</p>

<p><i>"Shit, that's- wait, hold on, are you</i> drunk<i>?"</i></p>

<p><i>Whoops,</i> thought Thomas.</p>

<p>He closed Beer, then split reality again instantly. Thankfully, he'd only had a little bit to drink. If he really thought about it, this way was even better, as he was able to doubly enjoy the wine.</p>

<p>Wait. Wasn't this the vintage he had been keeping to only the timelines he closed, so that he'd never run out?</p>

<p>Thomas looked down at the bottle in his hand, already a quarter empty.</p>

<p>"...aw, darn it."</p>

<p>His phone rang, a moment before he had been planning to throw it at the wall, which was awfully convenient. </p>

<p>"Tho-I mean, Coil speaking, how can I hel-I mean, who is this?"</p>

<p><i>"Listen Coil, I don't know what you're planning, but if you have anything up your sleeve, the time is</i> now, <i>Lung's after us and I think he brought Lee as backup. We're screwed if- whoa, Grue, what is</i> that<i>?!"</i></p>

<p>"Ah, call me back?"</p>

<p>The girl on the other end of the line had already hung up.</p>

<p>In Booze, he pressed down a button on his desk.</p>

<p><i>"Sir?"</i></p>

<p>Thomas marvelled for a few seconds at the fast response time. This had been his <i>dream</i> since he was a child - sure, his own base was great, but this gigantic red button that did literally <i>anything</i> was the best thing ever.</p>

<p>"Potts. I need you to do something for me."</p>

<p><i>"Yes, sir."</i></p>

<p>"The Undersiders have engaged with Lung at-" he took a moment to check the GPS tracker he'd installed in Tattletale's massive ego- "four thirty-second and fifteenth. I need to know what's going on."</p>

<p><i>"We have Goot and Schneider monitoring the scene, sir."</i></p>

<p><i>Chug, chug.</i></p>

<p><i>"Sir?"</i></p>

<p>Finally putting down the can of beer, Thomas let out his biggest burp of the day. Arguably.</p>

<p><i>"Sir, are you-"</i></p>

<p>Timeline Alcohol it was.</p>

<p><i>Bee-eeeep. "Sir?"</i></p>

<p>"Goot. What's going on? I need details."</p>

<p><i>"Sir, this is - pardon my language - crazy. The situation has gotten entirely out of control, it's completely destroyed an entire city block, somehow it's got more laser turrets than a Star Destroyer, we're lucky we haven't been hit in the crossfire."</i></p>

<p>"Slow down, slow down. You're telling me that Lung is firing <i>lasers</i>?"</p>

<p><i>"No! No, it's that new cape, sir. The one we talked about a few minutes ago?"</i></p>

<p>Thomas checked his short-term memory. Nope, no frantic discussions there. "Go on."</p>

<p><i>"It's a gigantic battle robot of some sort, from the looks of it. Lung was about to fry the Undersiders when it showed up."</i></p>

<p>"They're all alive?"</p>

<p><i>"S'far as I can tell, sir, nobody's even bruised. Crazy if you ask me, sir."</i></p>

<p>"What's happening right now? Give me the nitty-gritty, Goot."</p>

<p><i>"Sir, Lung is - Lung just went</i> down, <i>sir. And he's not getting up."</i></p>

<p>He'd won?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><i>He'd won!</i> Somehow, Coil had managed to twist things in just the right way that his underlings had survived. Not only that, he'd single-handedly taken down a major thorn in his side at the same time. </p>

<p>Well, sure, maybe he wasn't directly responsible. There was a degree of luck; he couldn't possibly have been able to know that an extremely powerful cape would have shown up just in time to save the day. But he <i>had</i> been drinking his lucky wine, and in his honest opinion, that merited a good fifty-one percent of the credit.</p>

<p>Alcohol closed, he split again and sat back, resting on his laurels in two universes simultaneously.</p>

<p><i>Aha</i>, thought Calvert. <i>Things are looking up.</i></p>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p><a href="flower-glossary.html">This</a> is a metainformation searcher for <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere">The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere</a>. It uses a fuzzy search library that enables searching for things you didn't even know you were looking for!</p>
    <p>At present, this searches the glossary, a curated set of acronyms, and a set of author quotes that may contain useful (?) information.</p>
